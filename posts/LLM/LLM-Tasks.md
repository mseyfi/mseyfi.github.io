# A Comprehensive Guide to LLM Tasks: From Fine-Tuning to Advanced Applications

A single, powerful pre-trained Large Language Model is a versatile foundation that can be adapted—or "fine-tuned"—to excel at a wide array of specific tasks. The key to this versatility lies in how we frame the task and format the data.

This tutorial provides a detailed breakdown of the most common and important tasks an LLM can perform, explaining for each: its goal, the data format for fine-tuning, a practical example, and the underlying mechanics.

***
## ![GenAI](https://img.shields.io/badge/1._Text_Generation_(and_Completion)-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)

* **The Goal:** To produce creative, coherent, and contextually relevant text that continues from a given prompt. This is the most fundamental autoregressive task and includes applications like story writing, paraphrasing, and email completion.
* **Architecture:** The quintessential task for Decoder-Only models (like the GPT series, Llama).


### Part 1: The Training Phase (Instruction Fine-Tuning)

**Goal:** To teach a pre-trained model to follow instructions by showing it high-quality `prompt` -> `completion` examples.


#### **Step 1.1: Prepare the Data**
You start with a dataset of prompt-completion pairs.
* **Prompt:** `"Write a short, optimistic phrase about the future."`
* **Completion:** `"The horizon ahead is bright and full of promise."`

#### **Step 1.2: The Training Process**
For each pair, we perform these steps:

1.  **Combine & Tokenize:** The prompt and completion are merged into a single sequence and converted to tokens.
    `[15, 439, 21, 74, 111, ..., 249, 13, 1146, 31, 1045, 2]`

2.  **Define Input Size (Context Window):** The model has a maximum sequence length it can handle, known as the **context window**. This is the effective "input size" during training. Common sizes are 2048, 4096, or even larger. Your combined `prompt + completion` sequence must fit within this window.

3.  **Feed Forward with a Masked Loss:**
    * The model processes the entire sequence, predicting the next token at every step.
    * **Causal Masking** ensures the model can't "cheat" by looking ahead.
    * A **Masked Cross-Entropy Loss** is applied. We only calculate the model's error on the `completion` tokens. This forces the model to learn: "Given this *kind* of prompt, generate this *kind* of completion."
#

### Part 2: The Generation Phase (Inference)

**Goal:** Now that the model is fine-tuned, we use it to generate a new completion from a new prompt.

#### **Step 2.1: Provide a Prompt**
We start with just a prompt and convert it to tokens.
* **User Prompt:** `"Give me a tagline for a new coffee shop."`
* **Input Tokens:** `[34, 25, 14, 982, 113, 21, 53, 642, 1099, 13]`

#### **Step 2.2: The Prediction Step (Model Forward Pass)**
The model processes the input tokens to predict the *very next token*. This involves two key final steps:

1.  **The Linear Layer (Projecting to Vocabulary):** The model's final internal representation is passed to a linear layer. This layer's job is to produce a raw score (a logit) for every single token in the model's vocabulary.
    * **Output Size (Logits):** This vector's size is equal to the **vocabulary size**. If the model knows 50,000 unique tokens, this output will be a list of 50,000 numbers.
    `[-2.1, 1.5, 0.3, 8.9, -4.5, ...]` (A score for every possible word).

2.  **The Softmax Function:** The raw logit scores are hard to interpret. The **softmax** function is applied to this vector to convert the scores into a clean probability distribution.
    * **Output (Probabilities):** A vector of the same size (`vocab_size`), where each value is between 0 and 1, and all values sum to 1.
    `[0.001, 0.005, 0.002, 0.92, 0.000, ...]`
    * This tells us the model's confidence for each potential next token. In this example, the fourth token in the vocabulary is predicted with 92% probability.

#### **Step 2.3: The Sampling Strategy (Choosing the Next Word)**
We have the probabilities, now we must choose one token. Instead of always picking the most likely one, we use a sampling strategy to encourage creativity and avoid repetitive text.

* **Greedy Sampling (Not Recommended):** Always pick the token with the highest probability. **Result:** Safe but often boring and repetitive.
* **Top-K Sampling:** Consider only the `k` most likely tokens. For example, if `k=50`, you ignore all but the top 50 tokens and then sample from that smaller group based on their probabilities. **Result:** Prevents truly weird tokens from being chosen while still allowing for variety.
* **Nucleus (Top-p) Sampling (Most Common):** Consider the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability is greater than `p`. If `p=0.9`, you'd add up the probabilities of the most likely tokens until you hit 90%. This set might include 3 tokens if the model is very confident, or 50 tokens if it's uncertain. **Result:** An adaptive and robust strategy that produces high-quality, creative text.

#### **Step 2.4: The Autoregressive Loop**
Text generation is a loop. Let's say we sampled the token for `"Your"`.

1.  **Append:** Add the new token to our input sequence.
    * **Old Input:** `[Give me a tagline for a new coffee shop.]`
    * **New Input:** `[Give me a tagline for a new coffee shop. Your]`

2.  **Repeat:** Feed this new, longer sequence back into the model (Step 2.2). The model now predicts the next token after "Your". Maybe it's "daily".

3.  **Continue:** Repeat this process—`predict -> sample -> append`—until the model generates a special `<end_of_sequence>` token or reaches a predefined length limit.

**Final Output:** `"Your daily dose of happiness."`

## 2. Dialogue Generation (Chatbots)

This tutorial explains how to take a general-purpose LLM and fine-tune it to be an interactive, multi-turn conversational agent that can remember context and adopt a specific persona.
#

### Part 1: The Training Phase (Fine-Tuning for Dialogue)

**Goal:** To teach a pre-trained model the structure, flow, and turn-taking nature of a human conversation. The model learns to act as a helpful assistant.

#### **Step 1.1: Prepare the Data (The Conversational Script)**

You start with a dataset of multi-turn dialogues. These dialogues are formatted with **special tokens** to clearly define who is speaking. This structure is critical for the model to learn its role.

Let's look at the format from your example (`<s>` is start of sequence, `</s>` is end of sequence, `[INST]` marks a user instruction).

**Example Dialogue:**
```
<s>[INST] What’s the capital of Germany? [/INST] The capital of Germany is Berlin.</s><s>[INST] What about France? [/INST] The capital of France is Paris.</s>
```

* **Special Tokens:** `<s>`, `[INST]`, `[/INST]`, `</s>` are not words; they are structural signposts. They teach the model: "When you see text between `[INST]` and `[/INST]`, that's the user speaking. Your job is to provide the text that comes after `[/INST]`."

#### **Step 1.2: The Training Process**

1.  **Combine & Tokenize:** The entire conversation, including all turns and special tokens, is concatenated into one long sequence and converted into numerical tokens.

2.  **Define Input Size (Context Window):** The model's context window (e.g., 4096 tokens) is crucial. A longer context window allows the chatbot to "remember" more of the previous conversation, leading to more coherent and context-aware responses.

3.  **Feed Forward with a Role-Specific Masked Loss:**
    * **Causal Masking** is always active. The model can only see past tokens to predict the next one.
    * A **specialized Masked Cross-Entropy Loss** is the key. The model's error (loss) is **only calculated for the tokens it is supposed to generate (the assistant's response)**.

Let's visualize the loss calculation for the first turn:

| Input Context Seen by Model           | Next Token to Predict | Is Loss Calculated?                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<s>[INST] What’s`                     | `the`                 | **NO** (This is the user's turn)                          |
| `...capital of Germany?`              | `[/INST]`             | **NO** (This is the user's turn)                           |
| `...Germany? [/INST]`                 | `The`                 | **YES!** (This is the start of the assistant's turn)       |
| `...Germany? [/INST] The`             | `capital`             | **YES!** (This is the assistant's turn)                    |
| `...is Berlin.`                       | `</s>`                | **YES!** (This is the end of the assistant's turn)         |

**Why this works:** You are not teaching the model how to *ask questions*; you are teaching it exclusively how to *answer* them, given the context of a user's question.
#

### Part 2: The Generation Phase (Inference / Having a Conversation)

**Goal:** Now that the model is fine-tuned, we can have a live, multi-turn conversation with it.

#### **Step 2.1: Start the Conversation (User's First Turn)**

We take the user's input and format it precisely as the model was trained, including the special tokens.

* **User Input:** `"What's the best way to get from San Jose to San Francisco?"`
* **Formatted for Model:** `<s>[INST] What's the best way to get from San Jose to San Francisco? [/INST]`

#### **Step 2.2: The Prediction Step (Model's First Response)**

The model processes the formatted input to generate its response one token at a time.

1.  **Linear Layer (Projecting to Vocabulary):** The model's final output is a vector of logits, with a size equal to its **vocabulary size** (e.g., 50,000). This represents a "score" for every possible next token.

2.  **Softmax Function:** The **softmax** function converts these scores into a probability distribution (`[0.01, 0.003, ..., 0.89, ...]`), showing the likelihood of each token being the correct next one.

3.  **Sampling Strategy:** We use a sampling method like **Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling** to choose a token from the probability distribution. This allows for fluent and natural-sounding responses.

#### **Step 2.3: The Conversational Loop (Maintaining Context)**

This is the most important part of a chatbot. The entire history is used to generate the next response.

1.  **Generate Full Response:** The model generates tokens autoregressively (`predict -> sample -> append`) until it produces an end-of-sequence token (`</s>`).
    * **Model's Response:** `"The best way depends on your priorities. Caltrain is a great option..."`

2.  **User's Next Turn:** The user replies.
    * **User's New Input:** `"I want to optimize for speed."`

3.  **Construct New Input:** **Crucially, you append the model's last answer and the user's new question to the history.** The new input fed to the model is the entire conversation so far, correctly formatted.
    `<s>[INST] What's the best way...? [/INST] The best way depends on...</s><s>[INST] I want to optimize for speed. [/INST]`

4.  **Repeat:** The model now generates a new response. Because it sees the *entire history*, it knows the user has prioritized speed and can give a tailored answer like, "In that case, driving outside of peak traffic hours is typically the fastest option." This loop continues, allowing the model to maintain context across many turns.

***

## 3. Text Classification
Use an LLM to perform text classification—the task of assigning a predefined category (like `Positive`, `Negative`, `Spam`, or `Legal`) to a piece of text. We will cover the two primary architectural approaches.
#

### Approach 1: The Encoder-Only Model (e.g., BERT)

This is the traditional and highly efficient method, optimized specifically for classification and understanding tasks.

#### **Part 1: The Training Phase** ⚙️

**Goal:** To train a model to "read" an entire piece of text and map its meaning to a single categorical label.

1.  **Prepare the Data:** The data consists of simple `(text, label)` pairs.
    * **Text:** `"I love this product! It works perfectly."`
    * **Label:** `Positive` (often represented as an integer, e.g., 0 for Positive, 1 for Negative).

2.  **The Training Process:**
    * **Input Formatting & Special Tokens:** Each text input is formatted with special tokens. A `[CLS]` (classification) token is added to the beginning, and a `[SEP]` (separator) token is added to the end.
        `[CLS] I love this product! It works perfectly. [SEP]`
    * **Input Size:** The input is truncated or padded to match the model's fixed **context window**, which is typically 512 tokens for models like BERT.
    * **Architecture & Masking:** The key is that encoder-only models are **bi-directional**. They use an **Attention Mask** to ignore padding tokens but do *not* use a causal mask. This allows every token to "see" every other token in the text, providing a holistic understanding.
    * **Loss Function:** The model processes the text. The final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token is used as a summary vector for the entire sequence. This vector is fed into a simple "classification head" (a linear layer) whose output size is the **number of classes**. If you have 3 labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral), the output size is 3. A standard **Cross-Entropy Loss** is calculated between the predicted class probabilities and the true label.

#### **Part 2: The Inference Phase** 💡

1.  **Format the Input:** A new, unseen piece of text is formatted with `[CLS]` and `[SEP]`.
    `[CLS] The flight was delayed again, and the staff was unhelpful. [SEP]`

2.  **Prediction:** The model performs a forward pass. It extracts the final embedding of the `[CLS]` token and passes it to the trained classification head. A **softmax** function is applied to the head's output to get a probability for each class.
    * **Output:** `[0.01, 0.99]` (Probabilities for Positive, Negative)

3.  **Final Label:** The label with the highest probability is chosen as the result.
    * **Result:** `Negative`
#

### Approach 2: The Decoder-Only Model (e.g., GPT, Llama)

This modern approach cleverly reframes classification as a text generation task.

#### **Part 1: The Training Phase** ✍️

**Goal:** To teach the model to complete a prompt with the correct label word.

1.  **Prepare the Data:** The `(text, label)` pairs are converted into a prompt-completion format.
    * **Prompt:** `"Review: I love this product! It works perfectly. Sentiment:"`
    * **Completion:** `Positive`

2.  **The Training Process:**
    * **Input Formatting:** The prompt and completion are combined into a single sequence for next-token prediction.
        `Review: I love this product! It works perfectly. Sentiment: Positive`
    * **Input Size:** The sequence must fit within the model's **context window** (e.g., 4096 tokens).
    * **Architecture & Masking:** This is a standard **decoder-only** setup using **causal masking**. The model can only see past tokens when predicting the next one.
    * **Loss Function:** A **Masked Cross-Entropy Loss** is used. The loss is calculated **only on the token(s) for the target label**. For instance, the model is only graded on its ability to predict the token `Positive` after seeing `... Sentiment:`.

#### **Part 2: The Inference Phase** 🔍

1.  **Format the Input:** The new text is placed into the prompt template, leaving the answer blank for the model to fill in.
    `Review: The flight was delayed again, and the staff was unhelpful. Sentiment:`

2.  **Prediction:** The model runs a forward pass and generates probabilities for the very next token. We are specifically interested in the probabilities of our potential label tokens (`Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`).
    * The model will output a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary.
    * We check the probabilities for our specific target words: `P("Positive") = 0.01`, `P("Negative") = 0.99`, `P("Neutral") = 0.00`.

3.  **Final Label:** We select the valid label token with the highest probability. This method ensures the model gives a constrained and valid answer.
    * **Result:** `Negative`

***

## 4. Natural Language Inference (NLI)
Natural Language Inference (NLI), breaking down the concepts, architecture, and processes in greater detail.
#

Natural Language Inference is a fundamental reasoning task in AI. Think of the model as a "logic detective" tasked with examining two statements: a piece of evidence (**the Premise**) and a claim (**the Hypothesis**). The model's job isn't to determine if the hypothesis is true in the real world, but only if it's true, false, or unrelated *based on the evidence provided in the premise*.

There are three possible verdicts:
* **`Entailment`**: The evidence proves the claim. The hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
* **`Contradiction`**: The evidence refutes the claim. The hypothesis logically contradicts the premise.
* **`Neutral`**: The evidence is irrelevant to the claim. The premise neither proves nor refutes the hypothesis.

#### **Example Data**

* **Premise:** `"A man in a blue shirt is riding a horse through a field."`
* **Hypothesis:** `"A person is outdoors."`
* **Target:** `Entailment` (Riding a horse through a field implies being outdoors).

#### **Use Case Scenarios**

NLI is a critical component for building more reliable and logical AI systems.
* **Validating AI-Generated Content:** If you ask an AI to summarize a legal document, you can use an NLI model to check if the summary's claims (`hypothesis`) are logically supported by the original text (`premise`). This helps prevent factual errors or "hallucinations."
* **Improving Search Engines:** NLI can help a search engine understand if a web page (`premise`) truly answers a user's query (`hypothesis`), going beyond simple keyword matching.
* **Fact-Checking Systems:** In a news article, if the premise is `"The company's profits soared to a record high in Q4"`, NLI can flag a user comment saying `"The company lost money in Q4"` as a `Contradiction`.

#

### Deep Dive: The Encoder-Only Architecture (The Gold Standard for NLI)

While other architectures can perform NLI, Encoder-Only models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa are purpose-built for this kind of task and consistently achieve the best performance.

#### **Why Encoders Dominate NLI**

The key is **bi-directional context**.

Imagine you're solving a logic puzzle with two pieces of text. You wouldn't just read the first one and then the second one. You'd read both, then jump back and forth, comparing specific words and phrases. This is what an encoder does.

* **Bi-directional Attention:** Every token in the input can "see" and "attend to" every other token, regardless of position. This allows the model to create direct connections, for example, between the word `"horse"` in the premise and the word `"animal"` in the hypothesis.
* **Holistic Understanding:** An encoder doesn't process text left-to-right. It builds a holistic representation of the *entire input sequence at once*. For a comparison task like NLI, this is a massive advantage over decoder models that are optimized for sequential, next-token prediction.

#

### The Training Phase in Detail 

**Goal:** To fine-tune a pre-trained encoder model to specialize in comparing sentence pairs and predicting their logical relationship.

#### **Step 1: Data Preparation & Tokenization**

The input data is meticulously structured to be fed into the model.

1.  **Start with the Pair:**
    * `Premise:` "The event is scheduled for Tuesday."
    * `Hypothesis:` "The event is on the weekend."
2.  **Add Special Tokens:** The sentences are concatenated into a single string with special tokens that act as structural signposts.
    * `[CLS]` (Classification): A token added to the very beginning. Its purpose is to act as a "gathering point" for the entire sequence's meaning, specifically for classification tasks.
    * `[SEP]` (Separator): A token used to mark the boundary between the two sentences.
3.  **Final Formatted Input:**
    `[CLS] The event is scheduled for Tuesday. [SEP] The event is on the weekend. [SEP]`
4.  **Tokenization:** This string is converted into a sequence of numerical IDs by the model's tokenizer.

#### **Step 2: The Forward Pass Through the Encoder**

1.  **Input Embeddings:** The numerical IDs are converted into vectors. Positional embeddings are added to give the model a sense of word order.
2.  **Processing through Encoder Layers:** The sequence of vectors is passed through a stack of Transformer Encoder layers. In each layer, the embedding for every token is updated based on its relationship with all other tokens via self-attention.
3.  **The `[CLS]` Token's Journey:** The `[CLS]` token is treated like any other token initially. However, because it can attend to every word in both the premise and the hypothesis, by the time it exits the final layer, its output vector (e.g., a 768-dimensional vector) has become a rich, aggregated representation of the *relationship between the two sentences*.

#### **Step 3: The Classification Head & Loss Function**

1.  **The "Head":** We take the single output vector of the `[CLS]` token from the final encoder layer. This vector is fed into a "classification head," which is typically a very simple neural network (often just one linear layer) that is added on top of the pre-trained model.
2.  **Output Logits:** The head's job is to project the 768-dimensional `[CLS]` vector down to a vector with a size equal to the number of labels. For NLI, this is a vector of size 3. These raw output scores are called **logits**.
    * `[CLS] vector (size 768) -> Classification Head -> Logits (size 3)`
3.  **Loss Calculation:** To train the model, we use **Cross-Entropy Loss**. This function compares the logits (after a softmax is applied) to the correct "one-hot" label. If the correct label is `Contradiction` (e.g., index 1), the target is `[0, 1, 0]`. The loss function calculates a penalty based on how far the model's prediction is from this target. This penalty is then used to update the weights of the classification head and, typically, to fine-tune the weights of the entire encoder model as well.

#

### The Inference Phase in Detail 💡

**Goal:** To use our fine-tuned NLI model to predict the relationship for a new, unseen pair of sentences.

1.  **Format the Input:** A new premise-hypothesis pair is formatted in the exact same `[CLS]...[SEP]...[SEP]` structure.
2.  **Perform Forward Pass:** The formatted input is fed through the fine-tuned model.
3.  **Extract the `[CLS]` Vector:** We take the final output vector corresponding to the `[CLS]` token.
4.  **Predict with the Head:** This vector is passed through the trained classification head, producing a logit vector of size 3.
5.  **Apply Softmax for Probabilities:** The softmax function is applied to the logits to convert them into a human-readable probability distribution.
    * `Logits: [-4.6, 6.2, -3.1]` -> `Softmax` -> `Probabilities: [0.001, 0.998, 0.001]`
6.  **Interpret the Output:** The final prediction is the label corresponding to the highest probability.
    * **Result:** `{ "label": "Contradiction", "score": 0.998 }`

#
### Alternative Architectures: The Decoder-Only Approach

While encoders are the specialized tool, a powerful decoder-only model like GPT-4 can also perform NLI by framing it as a question-answering or completion task.

* **Prompt Engineering:** You would need to create a detailed prompt that instructs the model on what to do.
    ```
    Based on the Premise, determine if the Hypothesis is an entailment, contradiction, or neutral.

    Premise: A man in a blue shirt is riding a horse through a field.
    Hypothesis: A person is outdoors.

    The logical relationship is:
    ```
* **Inference:** The model would then generate the next token. A well-instructed model would produce the word "Entailment".

**Pros and Cons for NLI:**
* **Pros:** Extremely flexible, requires no special architecture, can use few-shot prompting to learn the task on the fly.
* **Cons:** The left-to-right nature is fundamentally less suited for direct comparison than an encoder's bi-directional view. It can be less efficient and potentially less robust than a fine-tuned encoder specifically optimized for the NLI task.

***
## 5. Question Answering (QA)

### 5a. Extractive Question Answering

#### **Example Data**
The data consists of a `Context` and a `Question`. The target is not a string of text, but rather the starting and ending positions (indices) of the answer within the context.

* **Context:** `"The first iPhone was introduced by Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention."`
* **Question:** `"Who introduced the first iPhone?"`
* **Target:** `start_token_index: 10`, `end_token_index: 11` (Assuming "Steve" is the 10th token and "Jobs" is the 11th).

#### **Use Case Scenario**
The goal is to find and highlight a precise answer that already exists within a provided document. This is ideal for systems that need to be factual and grounded in a specific text.

* **A legal assistant is reviewing a contract:** The user asks, `"What is the termination clause notice period?"` The system scans the contract (`Context`) and extracts the exact phrase, like `"thirty (30) business days"`, highlighting it for the user.
* **Corporate knowledge base:** An employee asks the HR portal, `"What is the maximum rollover for vacation days?"` The system finds the answer directly in the employee handbook.
#

#### **How It Works: A Mini-Tutorial (Encoder-Only)**
This task is perfectly suited for Encoder-Only models like BERT because they can analyze the relationship between the question and the entire context simultaneously.

##### **Why Encoders Dominate Extractive QA**
The model needs to understand which part of the `Context` is most relevant to the `Question`. A bi-directional encoder can create rich connections between words in the question (e.g., "Who") and words in the context (e.g., "Steve Jobs"), making it highly effective at identifying the precise answer span.

##### **The Training Phase **

1.  **Input Formatting:** The question and context are combined into a single sequence for the model, separated by a special `[SEP]` token.
    `[CLS] Who introduced the first iPhone? [SEP] The first iPhone was introduced by Apple CEO Steve Jobs... [SEP]`
2.  **Architecture & The "Two Heads":** This is the unique part. Instead of one classification head on the `[CLS]` token, we add **two separate prediction heads** on top of **every single token's output vector** in the sequence.
    * **Start Token Head:** A simple linear layer that takes each token's final output vector (e.g., size 768) and produces a single score (a logit). This score represents how likely that token is to be the *start* of the answer.
    * **End Token Head:** A *different* linear layer that does the same thing, but its score represents how likely that token is to be the *end* of the answer.
3.  **Loss Function:** After a forward pass, we have two lists of scores: one for all possible start positions and one for all possible end positions.
    * A **softmax** function is applied across each list to convert the scores into probabilities.
    * The total loss is the sum of two **Cross-Entropy Losses**:
        1.  The loss for the start position (comparing the start probabilities to the true `start_token_index`).
        2.  The loss for the end position (comparing the end probabilities to the true `end_token_index`).
    * This trains the model to jointly predict the correct start and end boundaries for the answer.

##### **The Inference Phase 💡**

1.  **Format and Predict:** A new `(Question, Context)` pair is formatted and passed through the fine-tuned model. This produces two lists of probabilities: one for the start position and one for the end position.
2.  **Find Best Span:** We find the token index with the highest start probability (`best_start`) and the token index with the highest end probability (`best_end`).
3.  **Post-Process:** We check for valid spans (e.g., ensuring `best_end >= best_start`). More advanced methods find the span `(i, j)` that maximizes `P_start(i) * P_end(j)`.
4.  **Extract Answer:** The tokens from the `best_start` index to the `best_end` index are selected from the original context and converted back to a string. This string is the final answer.
#


### 1. How do we ensure `end_token_index >= start_token_index`?

You are absolutely right to ask this. If you simply take the `argmax` (the index with the highest score) of the start probabilities and the `argmax` of the end probabilities independently, you could easily end up with a `start_index` of 25 and an `end_index` of 10, which is nonsensical.

This is handled during the **inference/post-processing stage**. Here are the common strategies, from simple to robust:

#### Simple Approach: Check After Predicting
1.  Find the index of the highest start probability, let's call it `best_start_idx`.
2.  Find the index of the highest end probability, let's call it `best_end_idx`.
3.  **Check the condition:** If `best_end_idx < best_start_idx`, you conclude that the model could not find a valid answer and return an empty string or a "no answer found" message.

* **Drawback:** This is a bit naive. The model might have predicted a slightly lower-scoring but *valid* span (e.g., the second-best start and second-best end form a valid pair) that this approach would miss.

#### Robust Approach: Find the Best *Valid* Span (Most Common)

This is the standard and correct way to do it. Instead of finding the best start and end independently, you search for the **pair `(start, end)` that has the highest combined score, while respecting the constraint.**

Here is the algorithm:

1.  After the model's forward pass, you have two lists of scores (logits): `start_scores` and `end_scores`.
2.  Initialize a `max_score = -infinity` and `best_span = (null, null)`.
3.  Iterate through every possible start token index `i` in the sequence.
4.  For each `i`, iterate through every possible end token index `j`, **starting from `i`** (`j >= i`).
5.  You can also add another constraint to limit the maximum answer length, e.g., `if (j - i + 1 > max_answer_length): continue`.
6.  Calculate the combined score for the span `(i, j)`. The simplest way is `score = start_scores[i] + end_scores[j]`.
7.  If this `score` is greater than the current `max_score`, update:
    * `max_score = score`
    * `best_span = (i, j)`
8.  After checking all possible valid pairs, `best_span` will hold the indices for the best possible valid answer according to the model.

This search guarantees that your final `start_index` and `end_index` form a valid, logical span.

### 2. Do we take the softmax over the entire context length?

**Yes, absolutely.** You take the softmax over the **entire input sequence length**.

Let's clarify why.

1.  **Input:** Your model receives a single, long sequence of tokens: `[CLS] question_tokens [SEP] context_tokens [SEP]`. Let's say the total length is 384 tokens.
2.  **Output from Heads:** The model produces two vectors of raw scores (logits), each of length 384.
    * `start_logits` = `[score_for_token_0, score_for_token_1, ..., score_for_token_383]`
    * `end_logits` = `[score_for_token_0, score_for_token_1, ..., score_for_token_383]`
3.  **Softmax Application:** The softmax function is applied independently to each of these full vectors.
    * `start_probabilities = softmax(start_logits)`
    * `end_probabilities = softmax(end_logits)`

The result is two probability distributions, each of length 384, where the probabilities in each list sum to 1.

**Why is this necessary?**

The task is to find the single best start token **out of all possible tokens** in the context. The softmax function creates a "competition" among all the tokens. By applying it to the entire sequence, you are forcing the model to decide which token, from position 0 to 383, is the most likely start. The same logic applies to the end token.

If you only applied it to a smaller chunk, the model wouldn't be able to compare a potential answer at the beginning of the context with one at the end. The full-sequence softmax is what allows the model to pinpoint the single most probable start and end point across the entire provided text.

### 5b. Generative (Abstractive) Question Answering

#### **Example Data**
The data is typically a `Question` and a free-form `Answer`. The answer is not necessarily a direct quote from any text.

* **Input (Question):** `"Why is the sky blue?"`
* **Target (Answer):** `"The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where shorter-wavelength light, like blue and violet, is scattered more effectively by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere."`

#### **Use Case Scenario**
The goal is to generate a natural, human-like answer, either by synthesizing information from a provided document (abstractive summarization) or by drawing from its own vast internal knowledge learned during pre-training. This is the foundation of modern conversational AI.

* **General knowledge queries:** A student uses Google or ChatGPT to ask, `"Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms."`
* **Customer support chatbot:** A user asks, `"How do I reset my account password?"` The chatbot generates a step-by-step guide instead of just pointing to a paragraph in a manual.

#
#### **How It Works: A Mini-Tutorial (Decoder-Only or Encoder-Decoder)**
This is a classic text generation task, perfectly suited for Decoder-Only models like GPT or Llama.

##### **Why Decoders Excel at Generative QA**
The task is not to *find* an answer, but to *create* one. This requires generating a novel sequence of words in a coherent, fluent manner. This is precisely what the autoregressive, next-token-prediction nature of decoder models is designed to do.

##### **The Training Phase ✍️**

1.  **Input Formatting:** The training data is structured as a prompt-completion task. The prompt contains the question (and optionally a context), and the completion is the desired answer.
    * **Format:** `Question: Why is the sky blue? Answer:`
2.  **Architecture & Loss:** The setup is identical to other text generation tasks.
    * The model is a standard **decoder-only** architecture.
    * It uses **Causal Masking** to ensure it only sees past tokens when predicting the next one.
    * The loss function is **Masked Cross-Entropy Loss**, where the error is calculated *only* on the tokens of the target answer. This teaches the model: "When you see this question, generate this answer."

##### **The Inference Phase 🗣️**

1.  **Format Prompt:** The user's question is formatted into the same template used during training (e.g., `Question: Why is the sky blue? Answer:`).
2.  **Generate Autoregressively:** The model begins generating the answer one token at a time.
3.  **The Loop:** At each step, the model predicts the probabilities for the next token using its **linear layer** and a **softmax** function. A token is chosen via a **sampling strategy** (like Top-p). This new token is appended to the sequence, and the process repeats.
4.  **Complete Answer:** The generation loop continues until the model produces a special end-of-sequence token or reaches a predefined length limit. The full sequence of generated tokens is the final answer.

## 6. Information Extraction (Named Entity Recognition - NER)

#### **Example Data**

The goal of NER is to assign a categorical label to each token (or word) in a sentence. The data format consists of a sentence and a corresponding sequence of labels.

A common labeling format is the **IOB2 scheme**:
* **`B-TYPE`**: The **B**eginning of an entity of a certain TYPE (e.g., `B-PER` for Person).
* **`I-TYPE`**: **I**nside an entity of a certain TYPE. Used for entities that span multiple tokens.
* **`O`**: **O**utside of any entity.

* **Input Text:** `"Barack Obama was born in Hawaii."`
* **Tokenized Input:** `["Barack", "Obama", "was", "born", "in", "Hawaii", "."]`
* **Target Labels:** `[B-PER, I-PER, O, O, O, B-LOC, O]`

#### **Use Case Scenario**

The goal is to identify and pull out structured data (entities like people, organizations, dates, etc.) from unstructured, plain text.

* **An HR system processing a resume:**
    * **Input:** `"Worked as a software engineer at Google from 2019 to 2022."`
    * **System Extracts:** `{"Job Title": "software engineer", "Organization": "Google", "Start Date": "2019", "End Date": "2022"}`
* **News analysis:** Scanning thousands of articles to identify which companies are mentioned in relation to which locations.
* **Medical records:** Automatically extracting patient names, prescribed medications, and diagnoses from a doctor's notes.

#
#### **How It Works: A Mini-Tutorial (Encoder-Only)**
NER is a quintessential task for Encoder-Only models like BERT. The model needs to understand the full context of a word before it can classify it.

##### **Why Encoders are Ideal for NER**
The key is **bi-directional context**. To know if the word "Washington" refers to a person (`B-PER`) or a location (`B-LOC`), you need to see the words that come *after* it.
* "**Washington** spoke to Congress..." -> "Washington" is a person.
* "I am flying to **Washington** D.C...." -> "Washington" is a location.
An encoder model sees the entire sentence at once, allowing it to use both past and future context to make the most accurate decision for each word.

##### **The Training Phase ⚙️**

1.  **Input Formatting & Tokenization:** The input text is tokenized into a sequence of tokens (or more often, subwords). The target is a corresponding sequence of labels.
    * **Handling Subwords:** A critical detail is how to handle words that are broken into subwords (e.g., "Cupertino" -> `["Cuper", "##tino"]`). The standard approach is to assign the full label to the first subword (`B-LOC` for `"Cuper"`) and a special label (often `X` or simply the corresponding `I-` tag) to subsequent subwords (`I-LOC` for `"##tino"`). These subsequent subword predictions are often ignored during the loss calculation.
2.  **Architecture:** The model is a standard encoder. The unique part is the prediction head.
    * A single **classification head** is placed on top of **every token's final output vector**.
    * This head is a simple linear layer that projects the token's rich contextual embedding (e.g., a vector of size 768) to a vector of **logits**. The size of this logit vector is equal to the number of possible NER tags (e.g., 9 tags for `B-PER`, `I-PER`, `B-LOC`, `I-LOC`, `B-ORG`, `I-ORG`, `O`, etc.).
3.  **Loss Function:**
    * After the forward pass, you have a sequence of logit vectors—one for each input token.
    * A **Cross-Entropy Loss** is calculated **at each token position**. The model's predicted probability distribution for a given token is compared against the true label for that token.
    * The individual losses for all tokens in the sequence are then aggregated (usually by averaging) to get the final loss for the training step. The loss for padding tokens and subsequent subword tokens is ignored.

##### **The Inference Phase 💡**

1.  **Format and Predict:** A new sentence is tokenized and fed through the fine-tuned model. The model outputs a sequence of probability distributions, one for each input token.
2.  **Label Assignment:** For each token in the sequence, we perform an `argmax` on its probability distribution to find the most likely NER tag.
    * **Input:** `["Tim", "Cook", ",", "CEO", "of", "Apple"]`
    * **Raw Output Tags:** `[B-PER, I-PER, O, O, O, B-ORG]`
3.  **Post-Processing & Entity Extraction:** The raw sequence of tags is not the final output. A final, simple step is required to parse this sequence and group the tokens into structured entities.
    * The code iterates through the list of `(token, tag)` pairs.
    * When it sees a `B-PER` tag, it starts a new "Person" entity. It continues adding subsequent tokens with the `I-PER` tag to that same entity.
    * When it sees a different tag (like `O` or `B-ORG`), the current entity is considered complete.
    * This process converts the token-level predictions into the final, human-readable structured output.
    * **Final Structured Output:** `{"Person": "Tim Cook", "Organization": "Apple"}`

## 7. Text Summarization

#### **Example Data**
The data consists of pairs of long documents and their corresponding shorter, human-written summaries.

* **Input (Article Text):**
    > "SAN JOSE – Following months of speculation, local tech giant Innovate Inc. today announced the release of their flagship product, the 'Quantum Leap' processor. The company claims the new processor is twice as fast as its predecessor and consumes 30% less power, a significant step forward for mobile computing. CEO Jane Doe presented the chip at a press event, stating that devices featuring the Quantum Leap will be available to consumers by the fourth quarter of this year."

* **Target (Summary):**
    > "San Jose-based Innovate Inc. has unveiled its 'Quantum Leap' processor, which is reportedly twice as fast and more power-efficient, with products expected to ship by Q4."

#### **Use Case Scenario**
The goal is to generate a short, coherent, and accurate summary from a longer document, capturing the most important information.

* **Executive Briefings:** A financial analyst feeds a 30-page quarterly earnings report into the system. The LLM outputs a one-paragraph executive summary highlighting key metrics like revenue, profit, and future outlook for a quick review by executives.
* **News Aggregation:** Summarizing multiple news articles about the same event to provide a comprehensive overview.
* **Meeting Productivity:** Condensing a one-hour meeting transcript into a short list of key decisions and action items.
* **Scientific Research:** Generating an abstract for a long scientific paper to help researchers quickly grasp its findings.

#
#### **How It Works:**
Text summarization is a classic sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task. It can be tackled effectively by two main architectural approaches.

### Approach 1: Encoder-Decoder Models (The Classic Approach)
Models like BART, T5, and the original Transformer were purpose-built for tasks like summarization and translation.

##### **Why the Encoder-Decoder Architecture is a Natural Fit**
This architecture has a clear division of labor that mirrors the summarization task itself:
* **The Encoder's Job:** To read and "understand" the entire source document. It processes the text using **bi-directional attention**, creating a rich, contextualized representation of the input. Its goal is to compress the full meaning of the article into a set of hidden states.
* **The Decoder's Job:** To generate a new, shorter text (the summary). It generates the summary one word at a time, but with a special power: **cross-attention**.

##### **The Training Phase ⚙️**

1.  **Encoding the Input:** The full text of the long article is fed into the Encoder. The encoder processes it and produces a set of output vectors (hidden states), one for each input token.
2.  **Decoding the Output:** The Decoder is an autoregressive model that is fed the target summary (using a technique called "teacher forcing"). At each step of generating a token, the decoder does two things:
    * It uses **causal self-attention** to look at the summary words it has already generated.
    * It uses **cross-attention** to look back at the encoder's output vectors. This allows the decoder to "consult" the most relevant parts of the original article while writing the summary, ensuring the output is factually grounded.
3.  **Loss Function:** A standard **Cross-Entropy Loss** is calculated by comparing the decoder's predicted tokens to the actual tokens in the human-written target summary.

##### **The Inference Phase 💡**

1.  The new, long document is fed into the encoder exactly once to get its representations.
2.  The decoder begins with a start-of-sequence `[SOS]` token.
3.  It generates the summary autoregressively (`predict -> sample -> append`), using cross-attention at each step to stay focused on the source article's main points. Generation stops when it produces an end-of-sequence `[EOS]` token.

#

### Approach 2: Decoder-Only Models (The Modern Approach)
Large models like GPT and Llama can perform summarization by framing it as a standard text completion task.

##### **Why This Works**
Through massive scale and instruction fine-tuning, these models learn to recognize the task of summarization from a prompt. The model learns the pattern: "When given a long text and the instruction to summarize, produce a shorter version containing the key points."

##### **The Training Phase ✍️**

1.  **Input Formatting:** The article and summary are concatenated into a single sequence using a prompt template.
    ```
    Summarize the following article:

    <text of the long news article>

    Summary:
    <text of the short summary>
    ```
2.  **Architecture & Loss:** The setup is identical to dialogue generation.
    * The model is a standard **decoder-only** architecture using **causal masking**.
    * The loss function is **Masked Cross-Entropy Loss**. The error is calculated **only on the tokens of the target summary**. This teaches the model to specifically generate the summary portion when prompted.

##### **The Inference Phase 🗣️**

1.  A new article is placed into the prompt template, stopping right after `Summary:`.
2.  The model takes this entire text as its input prefix.
3.  It begins generating the text that should follow, effectively writing the summary one token at a time using the standard autoregressive loop (`predict -> sample -> append`).
***

## 8. Machine Translation

* **The Goal:** To translate a sequence of text from a source language to a target language.
* **Data Format:** Parallel sentences or documents.
    * **Input:** `"translate English to Spanish: The weather today is sunny and warm."`
    * **Target:** `"El clima hoy está soleado y cálido."`
* **Example Use Case:**
    * **Input:** `"I would like to book a hotel room for two nights."` (English to Japanese)
    * **LLM Output:** `"ホテルの部屋を二泊予約したいです。"`
* **How It Works:**
    * **Architecture:** The quintessential task for **Encoder-Decoder** models. The encoder gets a full understanding of the source sentence, and the decoder generates the target language.

---

## 9. Code-Related Tasks

* **The Goal:** To generate, complete, document, or translate code.
* **Data Format (for generation):** A natural language description paired with the corresponding code.
    * **Input:** `"Python function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number"`
    * **Target:** `"def fibonacci(n): ..."`
* **Example Use Case:**
    * **Prompt:** `"// A Javascript function that fetches data from a URL and logs it to the console"`
    * **LLM Output (Code Completion):**
        ```javascript
        async function fetchData(url) {
          try {
            const response = await fetch(url);
            const data = await response.json();
            console.log(data);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
          }
        }
        ```
* **How It Works:**
    * **Architecture:** This is a specialized application of **Decoder-Only** models. They are pre-trained on massive corpora of publicly available code (e.g., from GitHub) in addition to natural language text. The fine-tuning process is identical to text generation (Category 1).

---

## 10. Reasoning Tasks

* **The Goal:** To solve problems that require logical, arithmetic, or commonsense steps.
* **Data Format (for Chain-of-Thought fine-tuning):** The data includes the intermediate reasoning steps.
    * **Input:** `"If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many does he have left?"`
    * **Target:** `"John starts with 5 apples. He gives away 2. So we need to subtract 2 from 5. 5 - 2 = 3. The answer is 3."`
* **Example Use Case:**
    * **Prompt:** `"If a train leaves San Jose at 10:00 AM traveling at 60 mph and a car leaves at 11:00 AM traveling at 70 mph on the same route, at what time will the car catch up to the train?"`
    * **LLM Output:** A step-by-step breakdown of the relative speed, the head start of the train, and the final calculation for the time taken.
* **How It Works:** This is an **emergent capability** of very large models. It is significantly improved by fine-tuning on datasets that explicitly include a **Chain of Thought (CoT)**. By training the model to generate the reasoning steps *before* the final answer, it learns a more robust process for solving complex problems. The loss is calculated on the entire generated sequence (reasoning + answer).

#

## 11. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* **The Goal:** To ground the LLM's responses in external, verifiable knowledge, reducing hallucinations and allowing it to use up-to-date or private information.
* **Data Format:** This is not a fine-tuning task but an **inference-time architecture**.
* **Example Use Case:**
    * **User Question:** `"What were the key features announced for the iPhone 16 in today's keynote?"`
    * **RAG System Process:**
        1.  **Retrieve:** The system searches a database of recent news articles and finds several articles about the keynote from today, June 16, 2025.
        2.  **Augment:** It combines the text from these articles with the user's question into a new, large prompt.
        3.  **Generate:** The LLM receives the augmented prompt and generates a summary based *only* on the provided text.
    * **LLM Output:** `"According to the keynote reports, the key features announced for the iPhone 16 include a new A19 Bionic chip, a periscope zoom lens for the standard model, and an always-on display with dynamic widgets."`
* **How It Works:** RAG is a **system-level pattern** that combines a **retriever** (e.g., a search engine) with a standard **generative LLM**. The LLM's role is essentially to perform high-quality reading comprehension on the retrieved documents.

#

## 12. Multimodal Tasks

* **The Goal:** To understand and generate content that involves more than one modality, typically text and images.
* **Data Format:** The data consists of pairs of images and corresponding text.
    * **Input:** `(<image of a golden retriever playing in a park>, "What kind of dog is this?")`
    * **Target:** `"This is a Golden Retriever."`
* **Example Use Case:**
    * **(User uploads a photo of their lunch)**
    * **Prompt:** `"Estimate the calories in this meal."`
    * **LLM Output:** `"This meal appears to be a grilled chicken salad with avocado and a light vinaigrette. I would estimate it to be around 450-550 calories."`
* **How It Works:**
    * **Architecture:** This requires a specialized **Vision-Language Model (VLM)**, such as GPT-4o or Gemini. These models have two main components:
        1.  A **Vision Encoder** (like ViT) that processes the input image and converts it into a sequence of numerical embeddings.
        2.  A standard **Language Model** (typically Decoder-Only) that takes both the text embeddings and the image embeddings as its input sequence, allowing it to reason about the combined information.
