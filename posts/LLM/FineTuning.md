# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models
------

Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be approached in several ways, each balancing compute, memory, data efficiency, and performance. The major categories are:

---

## **1. Full Fine-Tuning**

* **What it is**: Update **all parameters** of the model using backpropagation on task-specific data.
* **Use case**: When you have **a lot of labeled data** and **enough compute** (e.g., cloud TPU/GPU clusters).
* **Pros**: Best performance; full model adapts.
* **Cons**: Extremely resource-intensive (memory, compute, storage).
* **Example**: Fine-tuning GPT-2 or BERT on a specific domain corpus.

---

##  **2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**

Only a **small subset** of parameters are updated. Popular PEFT methods include:

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; color: #555;font-weight: 485; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
As Large Language Models (LLMs) grew to billions of parameters, Full Fine-Tuning—updating every single weight for each new task—became prohibitively expensive. It required massive computational resources and resulted in a new, full-sized model copy for every task.

Adapter Tuning was proposed as a solution. The core idea is simple yet profound: what if we could freeze the massive pre-trained LLM, which already contains vast general knowledge, and only train a handful of tiny, new parameters for each specific task?

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; color: #555;font-weight: 485; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for large-scale pre-trained models. It allows us to adapt a model by introducing low-rank trainable matrices into certain parts of the network while keeping the original pre-trained weights frozen. <p></p>

## [![prefix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prefix_Tuning-LOW_RANK_ADaptation-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](FineTuning/Prefix-Tuning)
<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; color: #555;font-weight: 485; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
In the landscape of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), methods like Adapter Tuning modify the model's architecture by injecting new layers. Prefix-Tuning proposes an even less invasive idea: what if we could achieve specialized behavior without touching the model's architecture at all?

The core idea is to freeze the entire pre-trained LLM and learn a small sequence of special, continuous vectors—a "prefix"—that we prepend to the input. This learned prefix acts as an optimized set of instructions that steers the frozen LLM's attention and directs it to perform the desired task.<p></p>

## [![ptune](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prompt--Tuning-Prompt_Tuning/Soft_Prompts-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](FineTuning/Prompt-Tuning)
<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; color: #555;font-weight: 485; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
Prefix-Tuning was a powerful idea: steer a frozen LLM by learning continuous "virtual tokens" that are prepended to the keys and values in every attention layer. However, it had some challenges. The training could sometimes be unstable, and its performance wasn't always as strong as full fine-tuning on harder, smaller-scale datasets.

<b>Prompt-Tuning</b> was developed to address these issues. It adopts the core concept of using continuous prompts at the input layer.<p></p>

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; color: #555;font-weight: 485; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
<b>P-Tuning v2</b> introduces Deep Prompt Tuning. Instead of one instruction at the start, you place a small, expert guide on every single floor of the building. This guide provides continuous, layer-specific instructions to each department, ensuring the final output is exactly what you want. It's a continuous conversation with the model, not a single whisper at the start.

This deep guidance is why <b>P-Tuning v2<\b> is more powerful, stable across all model sizes, and excels at the complex tasks where shallow methods fail.<p></p>

## 🧷 **3. Prompt Tuning / Soft Prompts**

* Learn only a **small set of embedding vectors** (the "prompt") prepended to the input.
* Can be:

  * **Discrete** (crafted text)
  * **Soft** (learned embeddings)
* **No model weight change**, only optimize embeddings.
* Good for low-resource tasks.
* **Example**: [Lester et al. 2021 – "The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691)

## [![SFT](https://img.shields.io/badge/SFT-Instruction_Fine_Tuning(SFT)-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](FineTuning/SFT)
* Finetune on (instruction, response) pairs.
* Trains LLMs to follow human-written instructions.
* Often a precursor to RLHF.
* **Example**: FLAN-T5, Alpaca, OpenAssistant, etc.  
---

## 🧑‍⚖️ **5. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**

* Three stages:

  1. **SFT**: Train on instruction-following pairs.
  2. **Reward model**: Trained to rank outputs.
  3. **PPO**: Optimize model to maximize reward signal.
* Used in **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.**

---

## 💾 **6. Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT)**

* Continue **unsupervised pretraining** on in-domain text.
* No labels required.
* Useful for **medical, legal, code** domains.

---

## 🌱 **7. Multi-Task Fine-Tuning**

* Fine-tune on **multiple tasks simultaneously**.
* Model generalizes better across domains and instructions.
* Example: T5, FLAN.

---

## 🧬 **8. Quantized/Low-Precision Finetuning**

* Combine LoRA or adapters with **quantized models** (e.g., 4-bit QLoRA).
* Enables fine-tuning 65B+ models on consumer GPUs.
* Example: **QLoRA**, **GPTQ + LoRA**.

### 3. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

PEFT is a family of techniques born from the question: "Why update billions of parameters when you can get almost the same result by updating just a tiny fraction?" The core idea is to **freeze the massive pre-trained model** and only train a small number of new, added parameters. This is like adding small, lightweight attachments to a large, powerful engine instead of rebuilding the engine itself.



## [![prmt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prompt_Tunint-Prompt_Tuning/Prefix_Tuning-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](FineTuning/Prompt)

This is another PEFT method that takes a different approach. Instead of modifying the model, it modifies the input.

- **The Goal:** To steer the behavior of a completely frozen model by learning an optimal "prompt."

- How It Works:

   The entire LLM is frozen. A small sequence of special tokens (a "soft prompt" or "prefix") is added to the beginning of the input. 

  During training, only the embedding vectors for these special prefix tokens are updated.19

   The model learns the perfect "magic words" to prepend to any user input to guide the frozen LLM into producing the desired output for a specific task.

- **What is Trained:** Only the prefix embeddings (often just a few thousand parameters).

- **Pros:** The most parameter-efficient method.

- **Cons:** Can be less powerful than LoRA because it has less influence over the model's internal computations.

## [![RLHF](https://img.shields.io/badge/RLHHF-Reinforcement_Learning_from_Human_Feedback-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](FineTuning/RLHF)

RLHF is an advanced fine-tuning stage that comes *after* Instruction Fine-Tuning.20 Its goal is not to teach the model new knowledge, but to align its behavior with complex human values like helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.



- **The Goal:** To make a model more preferable and safer to interact with.

- How It Works (Simplified):

  1. **Collect Data:** Prompt the instruction-tuned model (SFT model) to generate several different answers to a single prompt. A human then ranks these answers from best to worst.

  2. **Train a Reward Model:** Train a separate model (the "reward model") on this data. Its job is to learn to predict which responses humans will prefer. It learns to output a score for any given response.

  3. Fine-tune with RL:

      Use a reinforcement learning algorithm (like PPO) to continue fine-tuning the SFT model. 

     The model generates a response, the reward model scores it, and this score is used as the "reward" to update the LLM's parameters.21

     The LLM gets "points" for generating responses that the reward model thinks a human would like.22

- What is Trained:

  The LLM's parameters are updated via reinforcement learning, and a separate reward model is also trained.23

- **Pros:** The most effective known method for reducing harmful outputs and aligning models with human preferences.

- **Cons:** A highly complex and expensive process requiring significant data collection and multiple training loops.
