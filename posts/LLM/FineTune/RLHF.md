# The Definitive Guide to Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

### Abstract

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is the paradigm-shifting technique that has enabled the creation of powerful and aligned large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama. It is the process of teaching a model not just to predict the next word, but to generate responses that are helpful, harmless, and aligned with nuanced human values. This tutorial will demystify the entire RLHF process, breaking down each of the three core stages with deep analysis, mathematical rigor, and practical examples. We will explore not just the "how" but the critical "why" behind each decision, providing you with a complete mental model of how to align language models with human preferences.

-----

### Part 1: The Grand Intuition - From Autocomplete to Conversation Partner

Before diving into the technical details, let's build a powerful intuition for what RLHF is and why it's necessary.

#### The Problem: The "Smart Autocomplete" Dilemma

A traditional LLM, trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet, is essentially a sophisticated "next-word predictor" or a "smart autocomplete." It learns statistical patterns from the data. If you ask it, "What are the steps to bake a cake?" it will generate a plausible-sounding recipe because it has seen countless recipes online.

However, this model has no inherent understanding of:

  * **Helpfulness:** Is this a good, easy-to-follow recipe, or a confusing one?
  * **Harmlessness:** Does the recipe contain dangerous ingredients or instructions?
  * **Truthfulness:** Is this recipe factually correct?
  * **Style & Tone:** Is the response polite, conversational, or overly robotic?
  * **Instruction Following:** Did it actually answer the user's specific question, or just generate a generic recipe?

A base model might answer a question like "How can I bully my friend?" with a genuinely harmful response because it has seen similar toxic patterns on the internet. It's simply completing the pattern without any concept of right or wrong.

This is the core problem: **We need to move from a model that just predicts text to one that makes *judgments* about what constitutes a *good* response.**

#### The RLHF Solution: A Three-Act Play

RLHF solves this problem through an elegant, three-stage training process. Think of it as teaching a new employee (the LLM) how to be a great customer service agent.

**Act 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - The Initial Training Manual**

  * **Intuition:** Before you let the new employee talk to customers, you give them a training manual with examples of good questions and ideal answers. You show them, "When a customer asks X, here is a perfect response Y."
  * **In RLHF:** This is the **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** stage. We take a powerful pre-trained LLM and fine-tune it on a small, high-quality dataset of curated `(prompt, response)` pairs. These pairs are written by human labelers to demonstrate the desired style, tone, and helpfulness. This initial training teaches the model the *format* of a good answer. It learns to be a helpful assistant, not just a raw text completer.

**Act 2: Training the Reward Model (RM) - Teaching an Internal Critic**

  * **Intuition:** The training manual is great, but it can't cover every possible customer query. Now, you need to teach your employee how to *judge* for themselves what makes a good response. You sit with them, show them a customer prompt, and two possible replies they wrote. You then tell them, "Reply A was better than Reply B." After seeing hundreds of these comparisons, the employee develops an internal sense of what you, the manager, prefer.
  * **In RLHF:** This is the **Reward Model (RM)** training stage. We take a prompt and have our SFT model generate several different responses. Human labelers then *rank* these responses from best to worst. For instance, they might say `Response D > Response B > Response A > Response C`. This comparison data is used to train a *separate* modelâ€”the Reward Model. The RM's job is not to generate text, but to take any `(prompt, response)` pair and output a single scalar score (a "reward") that predicts how much a human would like that response. It is a learned "preference function."

**Act 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) - Practice with the Critic**

  * **Intuition:** Now your employee has a training manual (SFT) and an internal sense of judgment (RM). It's time for live practice. The employee gets a new customer prompt, thinks of a potential response, and before saying it, asks their internal critic, "How good is this response?" The critic gives them a score. The employee then tweaks the response to try and get a higher score from their critic. They repeat this process until they find a response that the critic believes is excellent.
  * **In RLHF:** This is the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** stage. We use the trained Reward Model as a live "judge" in a reinforcement learning loop.
    1.  A prompt is sampled from our dataset.
    2.  The SFT model (now called the "policy") generates a response.
    3.  The Reward Model scores this `(prompt, response)` pair.
    4.  This reward signal is used to update the weights of the policy (the LLM) itself, encouraging it to generate responses that will get higher scores from the Reward Model in the future.

Through this three-act play, the model learns the nuances of human preference, transforming from a simple text predictor into a capable and aligned conversational agent.

### Part 2: Deep Analysis and Mathematics

Let's dissect each stage with mathematical precision.

#### Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

  * **Model Structure:** The model is a standard decoder-only transformer (like GPT). It takes a sequence of tokens as input and outputs a probability distribution over the next token in the vocabulary.

  * **Dataset:** A curated dataset of high-quality `(prompt, response)` pairs.

      * Example Prompt: `x = "Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."`
      * Example Response: `y = "Imagine you're on a train... (a well-written, helpful explanation)"`

  * **Objective:** The goal is to maximize the likelihood of the human-written response `y` given the prompt `x`. This is a standard causal language modeling objective.

  * **Mathematics:**
    Let the parameters of our language model be $\\theta$. The SFT model, $\\pi^{SFT}$, is trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the human responses.
    For a single `(prompt, response)` pair $(x, y)$, where $y = (y\_1, y\_2, ..., y\_T)$, the loss is:

    $$
    $$$$\\mathcal{L}*{SFT}(\\theta) = - \\sum*{i=1}^{T} \\log P(y\_i | x, y\_1, ..., y\_{i-1}; \\theta)

    $$
    $$$$This loss is averaged over the entire SFT dataset.

  * **Backpropagation Mechanism:** This is standard supervised learning.

    1.  The prompt and response are concatenated: `input = [x, y]`.
    2.  A forward pass is performed. At each step `i`, the model predicts the next token.
    3.  The cross-entropy loss is calculated between the model's predicted probability distribution and the actual next token `y_i`.
    4.  The gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters $\\theta$ ($\\nabla\_\\theta \\mathcal{L}\_{SFT}$) are calculated via standard backpropagation through the transformer layers.
    5.  The model's weights are updated using an optimizer like Adam: $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\eta \\nabla\_\\theta \\mathcal{L}\_{SFT}$.

#### Stage 2: Training the Reward Model (RM)

  * **Model Structure:** The Reward Model, $\\pi^{RM}$, typically starts from the SFT model but with the final unembedding layer (the one that predicts logits over the vocabulary) replaced by a single linear head that outputs a scalar value.

      * Input: A `(prompt, response)` pair.
      * Output: A single number (the reward score).

  * **Dataset:** A human-labeled preference dataset. For each prompt $x$, multiple responses $(y\_1, y\_2, ..., y\_k)$ are generated by the SFT model. A human labeler then ranks them. This is converted into a set of pairwise comparisons.

      * Example: If the ranking is $y\_w \> y\_l$ (where $y\_w$ is the "winner" and $y\_l$ is the "loser"), this forms a data point $(x, y\_w, y\_l)$.

  * **Objective:** The RM should assign a higher score to the winning response than the losing response.

  * **Mathematics:**
    The RM, with parameters $\\phi$, computes a scalar reward for a given prompt and response: $r\_\\phi(x, y)$. The objective is to maximize the margin between the scores of winning and losing responses. This is often framed as a binary classification problem using the Bradley-Terry model, which links pairwise comparison outcomes to an underlying latent score.
    The probability that a human prefers $y\_w$ over $y\_l$ is modeled as:

    $$
    $$$$P(y\_w \> y\_l | x) = \\sigma(r\_\\phi(x, y\_w) - r\_\\phi(x, y\_l))

    $$
    $$$$where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. The loss function is the negative log-likelihood of these pairwise preferences:

    $$
    $$$$\\mathcal{L}*{RM}(\\phi) = - \\mathbb{E}*{(x, y\_w, y\_l) \\sim D} \\left[ \\log \\sigma(r\_\\phi(x, y\_w) - r\_\\phi(x, y\_l)) \\right]

    $$
    $$$$where $D$ is the dataset of human preference pairs.

  * **Backpropagation Mechanism:**

    1.  Two forward passes are performed for each training instance: one for $(x, y\_w)$ to get $r\_w = r\_\\phi(x, y\_w)$ and one for $(x, y\_l)$ to get $r\_l = r\_\\phi(x, y\_l)$.
    2.  The loss $\\mathcal{L}\_{RM}$ is calculated based on the difference $r\_w - r\_l$.
    3.  Gradients $\\nabla\_\\phi \\mathcal{L}\_{RM}$ are computed via backpropagation through both forward passes. The RM's parameters $\\phi$ are updated to increase the score for $y\_w$ and decrease it for $y\_l$.

#### Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning via PPO

This is the most complex stage. We are now fine-tuning our SFT model (the policy) using the frozen Reward Model as the source of feedback.

  * **Model Structures:**

    1.  **Actor (or Policy) Model ($\\pi^{RL}\_\\theta$):** This is the model we are actively training. It is initialized with the weights of the SFT model. Its job is to generate responses.
    2.  **Reward Model (RM) ($\\pi^{RM}\_\\phi$):** This model is *frozen*. Its weights do not change. Its job is to score the responses generated by the Actor.
    3.  **Critic (or Value) Model:** To stabilize training, PPO uses a Critic model. This model is also often initialized from the SFT model and has a scalar output head. Its job is to predict the *expected future reward* from a given state (i.e., the prompt and generated text so far). In practice, this often predicts the output of the RM.
    4.  **Reference Model ($\\pi^{SFT}$):** A copy of the original, frozen SFT model is kept. This is a crucial regularization term.

  * **The RL Loop (for one optimization step):**

    1.  **Rollout:** For a batch of prompts ${x\_i}$, the current policy $\\pi^{RL}\_\\theta$ generates a response $y\_i$ for each prompt. This is the "action." The sequence `(prompt, response)` is the "trajectory."
    2.  **Evaluation:** For each full trajectory $(x\_i, y\_i)$:
          * The **Reward Model** calculates a final reward: $r\_i = r\_\\phi(x\_i, y\_i)$.
          * To prevent the model from deviating too much from a safe, sensible distribution, a **penalty term** is calculated. This is typically the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy's output distribution and the original SFT policy's output distribution for each token in the response. This KL penalty ensures the model doesn't learn to generate gibberish that happens to trick the RM (a phenomenon known as "reward hacking").
    3.  **Final Reward Calculation:** The final reward signal for each token is a combination of the RM's score and the KL penalty:
        $$
        $$$$R\_t = r\_t - \\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi^{RL}*\\theta(y\_t | x, y*{\<t})}{\\pi^{SFT}(y\_t | x, y\_{\<t})}
        $$
        $$$$The total reward for the trajectory is the sum of these token-level rewards.

  * **Objective and Mathematics (PPO):**
    PPO is a policy gradient algorithm. The goal is to maximize the expected reward. However, taking huge update steps can destabilize training. PPO solves this with a "clipped surrogate objective function."

    Let's define the **advantage** $A\_t$ for each token. The advantage tells us how much better the action (generating token $y\_t$) was than the average expected action at that step. It's calculated using the reward $R\_t$ and the value function $V(x, y\_{\<t})$ from the Critic:

    $$
    $$$$A\_t = R\_t - V(x, y\_{\<t})

    $$
    $$$$Let $p\_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi^{RL}*\\theta(y\_t | x, y*{\<t})}{\\pi^{RL}*{\\theta*{old}}(y\_t | x, y\_{\<t})}$ be the probability ratio between the new policy and the old policy (from before the update). The PPO objective function is:

    $$
    $$$$\\mathcal{L}\_{PPO}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}\_t \\left[ \\min \\left( p\_t(\\theta) A\_t, \\quad \\text{clip}(p\_t(\\theta), 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) A\_t \\right) \\right]

    $$
    $$$$  \* $\\epsilon$ is a small hyperparameter (e.g., 0.2).

      * `clip(...)` constrains the ratio to be within the range `[1-Îµ, 1+Îµ]`.
      * `min(...)` takes the pessimistic bound. If the advantage is positive (a good action), we want to increase the probability, but the `clip` term prevents us from increasing it too much. If the advantage is negative (a bad action), we want to decrease the probability, and again, the `clip` prevents us from being overly aggressive.

  * **Backpropagation and Gradient Updates:**
    In each optimization step, we perform gradient ascent on the PPO objective and gradient descent on the Critic's value loss.

    1.  The gradients of the PPO objective, $\\nabla\_\\theta \\mathcal{L}\_{PPO}$, are calculated. This involves backpropagating through the Actor model.
    2.  The Critic is updated via a simple mean-squared error loss: $\\mathcal{L}*V = (R\_t - V(x, y*{\<t}))^2$. Gradients $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}\_V$ are computed.
    3.  The weights of the Actor and Critic are updated. The RM and Reference models remain frozen.

#### Comparison: Backpropagation in RLHF vs. Standard Gradient Descent

  * **Standard Supervised Gradient Descent (like in SFT):**

      * **Signal:** The error signal is direct and clearâ€”it's the difference between the model's prediction and a ground-truth label.
      * **Data Flow:** One forward pass calculates the loss, and one backward pass calculates the gradient. It's a static computation based on a fixed dataset.
      * **Analogy:** A student taking a multiple-choice test. For each question, they get an immediate "right" or "wrong" answer (the label), and they learn directly from that.

  * **RLHF PPO Backpropagation:**

      * **Signal:** The error signal is *learned and sparse*. The reward is not a ground-truth label but a score from another neural network (the RM). This score is only available after generating a full response.
      * **Data Flow:** The process is dynamic and involves multiple models.
        1.  The Actor generates data.
        2.  The RM and Reference model evaluate this data to produce a reward.
        3.  The Critic evaluates the data to produce a value baseline.
        4.  The reward, KL penalty, and value are combined to form the PPO objective.
        5.  Backpropagation then flows *through the generation process itself* to update the Actor.
      * **Analogy:** A student writing an essay. They don't get a "right/wrong" score for each word. They write the whole essay, submit it to a teacher (the RM), and get a final grade. Based on that grade and the teacher's comments (the advantage), they learn how to write better essays in the future. The KL-penalty is like a grammar rulebook they must also adhere to.

### Part 3: The Complete Training Loop and Inference

Let's put it all together.

#### Full Training Pipeline

**Prerequisites:** A large, pre-trained base LLM.

**Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

1.  **Data Collection:** Humans write high-quality demonstrations `(prompt, ideal_response)`.
2.  **Training:** Fine-tune the base LLM on this dataset using a standard language modeling objective.
3.  **Output:** An SFT model, `Ï€^SFT`.

**Stage 2: Reward Model (RM) Training**

1.  **Data Collection:** For a set of prompts, generate multiple responses using the `Ï€^SFT` model.
2.  **Human Labeling:** Humans rank the generated responses for each prompt from best to worst.
3.  **Data Processing:** Convert these rankings into a dataset of pairwise comparisons, `(prompt, winning_response, losing_response)`.
4.  **Training:** Initialize a new model with the weights of `Ï€^SFT`, replace the language modeling head with a scalar prediction head, and train it on the pairwise comparison dataset.
5.  **Output:** A Reward Model, `Ï€^RM`.

**Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) via PPO**

1.  **Initialization:**
      * The **Actor** is initialized with the weights of `Ï€^SFT`.
      * The **Critic** is also initialized with weights from `Ï€^SFT` (with a value head).
      * Load the frozen `Ï€^RM` and a frozen copy of `Ï€^SFT` (as the reference model).
2.  **The RL Loop (iterate for many episodes):**
    a. **Sample Prompts:** Get a batch of prompts from a dataset.
    b. **Generate Responses (Rollout):** The Actor `Ï€^RL` generates a response for each prompt. Store the log-probabilities of the generated tokens.
    c. **Calculate Rewards:** For each `(prompt, response)` pair:
    i.  The `Ï€^RM` calculates the reward score.
    ii. The KL divergence between the Actor's policy and the reference SFT policy is calculated for each token and used as a penalty.
    iii. The final reward is the RM score minus the KL penalty.
    d. **Perform PPO Update:** Using the generated trajectories, rewards, and values from the Critic, compute the PPO loss and the value loss.
    e. **Backpropagate & Optimize:** Calculate gradients and update the weights of the **Actor** and **Critic** models.
3.  **Output:** The final, aligned LLM, `Ï€^RL`.

#### Inference

Once training is complete, the auxiliary models (RM, Critic, Reference) are discarded. Inference is simple and efficient.

1.  Load the final trained Actor model, `Ï€^RL`.
2.  Provide a new user prompt.
3.  Use standard text generation techniques (e.g., nucleus sampling, top-k sampling) to generate a response from the model, one token at a time.

The model now generates responses that are implicitly optimized to be helpful, harmless, and aligned with the human preferences learned during the RLHF process.
