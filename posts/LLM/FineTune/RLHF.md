## The Ultimate Guide to Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

#### **Abstract**

The leap from a language model that can write an essay to one that can have a helpful, harmless, and nuanced conversation is not a matter of scale alone. It is a matter of *alignment*. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is the critical framework that aligns the raw predictive power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex human values. It is the training philosophy behind transformative models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama 2.

This guide is designed to be a definitive, deep-dive resource. We will journey from the absolute basics of Reinforcement Learning to the sophisticated mechanics of the latest alignment algorithms. Using the guiding intuition of training a skilled diplomat, we will demystify the entire three-stage RLHF process, dissecting the model architectures, loss functions, and backpropagation mechanisms that make it possible. By the end, you will have a complete mental model of how we teach machines to converse not just with statistical correctness, but with judgment.

-----

### **Part 1: Foundations - What is Reinforcement Learning?**

Before we can understand RLHF, we must first understand its foundation: Reinforcement Learning (RL). At its core, RL is a framework for learning through trial and error to achieve a goal.

#### **The Core Intuition: Training a Dog**

Imagine you're teaching a dog a new trick, like "sit."

You say the word "sit" (this is the **state** of the world for the dog). The dog, initially, might do something random—it might bark, lie down, or spin in a circle (these are **actions**). If, by chance, the dog sits, you give it a treat (a **reward**). If it does anything else, you give it nothing.

Over many repetitions, the dog begins to form a connection: "When I'm in the 'hear sit' state and I perform the 'sit down' action, I get a positive reward." This connection is the dog's internal strategy, or **policy**. Gradually, the dog refines this policy to maximize its cumulative reward (get as many treats as possible).

This is the essence of Reinforcement Learning.

#### **The Key Terminologies**

Let's formalize this with the standard RL vocabulary:

1.  **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker. This is our LLM. In the analogy, it's the dog.
2.  **Environment:** The world in which the agent operates. For an LLM, this is the abstract space of conversation. For the dog, it's the room with the trainer.
3.  **State ($S$):** A snapshot of the environment at a particular moment. For an LLM, the state is the current prompt plus all the text generated so far (e.g., `"User: Explain gravity. \n Assistant: Gravity is a fundamental force that..."`).
4.  **Action ($A$):** A choice the agent makes to transition from one state to another. For an LLM, an action is **generating the next token** from the vocabulary.
5.  **Reward ($R$):** The scalar feedback signal the agent receives after taking an action in a state. This is the most important—and most difficult—part of RLHF. A positive reward encourages the preceding actions; a negative reward discourages them.
6.  **Policy ($\\pi$):** The agent's brain or strategy. It is a function that maps a state to an action. For an LLM, the policy **is the neural network itself**. Given the current state (text generated so far), the policy $\\pi$ outputs a probability distribution over all possible next tokens (actions). We train the model by adjusting the parameters of the policy.

The goal of any RL algorithm is to find an optimal policy, $\\pi^\*$, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

-----

### **Part 2: The RLHF Framework - The Diplomat's Training Program**

Now, let's apply this to LLMs. Our goal is to train a skilled diplomat (the LLM). A diplomat needs more than just knowledge (pre-training); they need to understand etiquette, nuance, and how to craft persuasive and safe arguments.

The RLHF curriculum has three stages.

#### **Stage 1: Foundational Briefing - Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

  * **Intuition:** Before a diplomat is sent on a mission, they study briefing books containing examples of ideal diplomatic cables, speeches, and conversation transcripts. This teaches them the expected style, tone, and format.
  * **Process:** We take a pre-trained LLM and fine-tune it on a small, high-quality dataset of `(prompt, ideal_response)` pairs created by human labelers. The model learns to mimic the style of these ideal responses.
  * **Objective:** This is standard supervised learning. The model's policy, $\\pi^{SFT}$, is trained to maximize the probability of generating the human-written response. The loss function is the classic cross-entropy loss over the tokens in the ideal response:

$$
\mathcal{L}^{SFT}(\theta) = - \sum_{i=1}^{T} \log \pi^{SFT}(y_i | x, y_j~\text{for}{j < i}; \theta)
$$

where $(x, y)$ is a prompt-response pair from the dataset.

#### **Stage 2: Learning a "Sense of Protocol" - The Reward Model (RM)**

  * **Intuition:** A diplomat can't rely solely on briefing books. They need an internal "sense of protocol"—the ability to judge whether a novel statement is effective or offensive. To build this, a senior diplomat might review two potential statements and tell the apprentice, "Statement A is better than Statement B."

  * **Process:** This is the **Reward Model (RM) Training** stage. It is crucial and happens *before* the main RL loop.

    1.  **Data Collection:** We take a prompt, $x$, and use our SFT model to generate several different responses, ${y\_1, y\_2, y\_3, y\_4}$.
    2.  **Human Ranking:** A human labeler ranks these responses from best to worst. For example: $y\_2 \> y\_4 \> y\_1 \> y\_3$.
    3.  **Create Input/Output Pairs:** This ranking is broken down into pairwise comparisons. The above ranking creates pairs like `(prompt: x, chosen: y_2, rejected: y_4)`, `(prompt: x, chosen: y_2, rejected: y_1)`, `(prompt: x, chosen: y_4, rejected: y_1)`, etc. This becomes our training dataset.

  * **Model Structure and Loss Function:**

      * The Reward Model is typically the SFT model with its final vocabulary-prediction head removed and replaced with a single linear head that outputs one scalar value (the reward).
      * The RM takes a `(prompt, response)` pair and outputs a score, $r\_{\\phi}(x, y)$, where $\\phi$ are the RM's parameters.
      * **The Loss Function:** The goal is for the RM to give a higher score to the chosen response ($y\_w$) than the rejected one ($y\_l$). This is framed as a binary classification problem using the **Bradley-Terry model**, which states that the probability of preferring one over the other is the sigmoid of the difference in their scores. The loss is the negative log-likelihood of these human preferences:

$$
\mathcal{L}^{RM}(\phi) = - \mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \left[ \log \sigma \left( r_{\phi}(x, y_w) - r_{\phi}(x, y_l) \right) \right]
$$

where $D$ is the dataset of preference pairs and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. During training, we backpropagate this loss to update the RM's parameters, $\phi$, teaching it to accurately mimic the human labeler's judgment.

At the end of this stage, we have a frozen, reliable "sense of protocol"—a Reward Model that can score any response for its helpfulness and harmlessness.

-----

### **Part 3: The Actor, the Critic, and the Advantage: A Deeper Look**

This is the heart of the PPO algorithm. Before diving into the full PPO process, we must understand the key players: the Policy (Actor), the Critic, and how they combine to produce the Advantage signal. This is a framework known as **Actor-Critic**.

#### **What are the Policy (Actor) and the Critic?**

Imagine our diplomat (the LLM) has two minds working together:

1. **The Actor (The Policy, $\pi_\theta$):** This is the part of the brain that **decides what to do**. It looks at the current situation (the state, $S_t$) and chooses an action (generates the next token, $A_t$). The policy *is* the LLM's primary function. Its parameters, $\theta$, are what we want to improve.
2. **The Critic (The Value Function, $V_\phi$):** This is the part of the brain that **evaluates the situation**. It doesn't decide what to do. Instead, it looks at the current state ($S_t$) and predicts the likely total future reward it can expect to get from this point onwards. It answers the question: "Given the conversation so far, how well are things likely to go from here?" Its parameters are $\phi$.

#### **What is the Structure of the LLM? Is it Multi-headed?**

**Yes, exactly.** In the PPO stage of RLHF, the model we are training is typically a single Large Language Model with a shared "body" (the main transformer blocks) and **two separate "heads"**:

1. **The Policy Head (Actor Head):** This is the standard language model head. It takes the final hidden state of a token and outputs logits over the entire vocabulary, defining the probability distribution for the next token. This is what generates the text.
2. **The Value Head (Critic Head):** This is a new head added to the model. It's usually a simple linear layer that takes the final hidden state of a token and outputs a **single scalar number**. This number is the value estimate, $V(S_t)$.

So, when we perform a forward pass with the LLM during PPO training, we get two outputs simultaneously from the same underlying model representation: an **action probability distribution** from the policy head and an **expected future reward** from the value head. This shared structure is computationally efficient.

#### **The Advantage Function ($A_t$): "Better or Worse Than Expected?"**

Now we can finally understand the Advantage function. Its purpose is to provide a much more stable and effective learning signal than just using the raw reward.

**The Problem with Raw Rewards:** Imagine playing a video game where every action gives you points. You end with a high score of 10,000. Does that mean every single action you took was good? Probably not. Some actions might have earned you 5 points when you could have taken a different action to earn 100 points. Just because the final outcome was good doesn't mean every intermediate step was optimal.

**Advantage Provides a Better Signal:** The Advantage function solves this by normalizing the reward. It calculates how much better or worse an action was compared to the average or expected outcome for that situation.

The formula is:

$$
A_t=R_t−V(S_t)
$$

Let's break this down with our diplomat analogy:

- $S_t$: The state is the current conversation. E.g., "The foreign minister just accused us of espionage."
- $R_t$: The actual reward received after the diplomat says something. Let's say the Reward Model gives a score of `+5`.
- $V(S_t)$: The Critic's prediction. Based on the tense situation, the Critic might have predicted a low expected future reward. It might have thought, "This is a tough spot. On average, we probably only get a reward of `-10` from here." So, $V(S_t)=−10$.

Now, let's calculate the advantage:

$$
A_t=R_t−V(S_t)=5−(−10)=+15.
$$

The interpretation is profound:

The raw reward was +5, which seems okay. But the advantage is +15, which is a very strong positive signal. It tells the learning algorithm: "This action was not just good; it was dramatically better than we expected in this difficult situation! We should strongly reinforce this behavior."

Conversely, if the reward was `+2`, but the Critic expected `+20`, the advantage would be 2−20=−18. This negative signal says, "Even though you got a positive reward, that action was a huge missed opportunity compared to what was possible. We should discourage this behavior."

The Advantage function creates a **relative, zero-centered learning signal**, which is much more stable and informative for updating the policy than the raw reward alone.

Another example is a teacher that predicts a not very strong student to do not so good in the exam based on the past achievements $V(s_t) = 60\%$, but the students gets a grade (reward) $R_t=75\%$, although this grade is not that good but it is a huge progress (15 marks above the expectation). This means whatever the student has done is in the right direction and has to be perused.

### **Part 4: Field Practice, The Classic Way - PPO**

With our understanding of the Actor, Critic, and Advantage, we can now fully describe the PPO process.

- **The PPO Quartet:** PPO uses four models/components:
  1. **The Actor (Policy $\pi_{\theta}$):** This is the LLM we are actively training (including the first next-token prediction head). It looks at the state and decides on an action (generates the next token). Its parameters, $\theta$, are the only ones being updated by the PPO loss.
  2. **The Critic (Value Function, $V_\phi$):** This component evaluates the state. As we detailed earlier, it's typically a second "head" on the Actor model. It looks at the current text and predicts the total future reward it expects to receive. It doesn't act; it only judges the situation.
  3. **The Reward Model (RM):** This model is **frozen**. It was trained in Stage 2. Its only job is to provide the immediate reward signal, $R_t$, for the actions taken by the Actor.
  4. **The Reference Model ($\pi_\text{ref}$):** This is a **frozen** copy of the SFT model from Stage 1. Its purpose is to act as a safety rail. It provides a baseline distribution that we don't want the Actor to stray too far from, preventing it from forgetting its core language capabilities.

- **The Probability Ratio ($p_t(\theta)$): Quantifying the Policy Change**

  ​This is the second crucial component, and your question about it is key. The formula is:
  
  $$
  p_t(\theta)=\frac{\pi_{\theta_\text{new}}(y_t∣S_t)}{\pi_{\theta_\text{old}}(y_t∣S_t)}
  $$
  
  ​**What is it, really?** The probability ratio, $p_t(\theta)$, is a direct measure of **how our strategy is changing**. It doesn't just look at the new probability of an action; it compares it to the old probability.	
    
  **Intuition: The Baseball Manager.** Imagine you are a baseball manager, and your policy, pi, is your strategy for telling a player whether to swing at a pitch.
    
  **The "Old" Policy ($\pi_{\theta_{old}}$):** At the beginning of a training step, you collect data. Let's say your strategy tells the player to swing at a specific pitch with a 	50% probability. This "old" policy is now fixed for the duration of this update step.
  
  ​**The Update:** After analyzing the outcome, your optimizer suggests a new policy, $pi_{\theta_\text{new}}$. This new policy now says to swing at that same pitch with a 75% probability.
  
  ​**Calculating the Ratio:** The ratio is $p_t(\theta)=75$. This value of 1.5 tells you precisely that your new strategy is "1.5 times more aggressive" for this specific action. If the new probability was 25%, the ratio would be 0.5, meaning "half as aggressive."
  
  ​**Why is this Ratio so Important?** The goal of PPO is to control the *size* of the policy update. A raw probability doesn't tell you how big of a step you took, but the ratio does. PPO's loss function is designed to directly constrain this ratio. It uses the ratio to ensure that even if an action has a massive advantage, the policy update doesn't become too extreme (e.g., the ratio is not allowed to become 100.0), which would risk destabilizing the entire model.

- **The PPO Loss Function:** The goal is to update the Actor's parameters theta using the Advantage signal, but in a safe way.
  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{PPO}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( p_t(\theta) A_t, \quad \text{clip}(p_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) A_t \right) \right]
$$

This objective uses the calculated Advantage ($A_t$) to scale the update, while the clip function ensures the policy doesn't change too drastically in a single step, maintaining stability.

#### **How the Policy (LLM) is Trained with PPO**

The training loop for PPO is an active, "online" process:

1.  **Rollout:** The current policy (the Actor LLM) generates a batch of responses to a set of prompts.
2.  **Evaluation:** For each generated token, we calculate the advantage, $A_t$. This requires getting a score from the frozen **Reward Model** and a baseline from the **Critic** model. We also calculate a **KL-penalty** against the frozen SFT **Reference Model** to ensure the LLM doesn't forget its core language skills.
3.  **Optimization:** We use the trajectories of states, actions, and advantages to compute the PPO loss, $\mathcal{L}_\text{PPO}$.
4.  **Backpropagation:** The gradient of this loss is computed with respect to the **Actor's** parameters ($\theta$). This gradient tells the LLM how to adjust its weights to make high-advantage actions more likely and low-advantage actions less likely, all while staying within the safe "clipped" region. The Critic is also updated simultaneously with a simpler mean-squared error loss.

-----

### **Part 4: Field Practice, The Modern Way - DPO**

PPO is powerful but notoriously complex, requiring four models and a slow sampling loop. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a more recent breakthrough that achieves the same goal with stunning simplicity.

  * **Intuition:** DPO realizes we don't need to build an explicit "sense of protocol" (an RM) and then have the diplomat practice with it. We can use the raw comparison data ("Statement A \> Statement B") to *directly refine the diplomat's instincts*. It's a more direct form of learning that bypasses the need for an explicit judge and a complex simulation.

#### **The DPO Loss Function: The Elegant Shortcut**

DPO's brilliance is a mathematical insight that connects the reward function directly to the policies.

1.  **The Insight:** The optimal reward function that PPO tries to learn can be expressed analytically as the log-probability ratio between the optimal policy ($\\pi\_\\theta$) and the reference policy ($\\pi\_{ref}$), scaled by a constant $\\beta$.

    $$
    $$$$r(x, y) = \\beta \\log \\left( \\frac{\\pi\_{\\theta}(y|x)}{\\pi\_{ref}(y|x)} \\right)

    $$
    $$$$
    $$
2.  **The Derivation:** By substituting this definition of reward back into the RM's loss function, the terms rearrange into a new loss function that depends *only* on the policy we are training and the frozen reference policy. The RM is eliminated entirely.

The final **DPO Loss Function** is:
$$\mathcal{L}_{DPO}(\theta; \pi_{ref}) = - \mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \left[ \log \sigma \left( \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w|x)}{\pi_{ref}(y_w|x)} - \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_l|x)}{\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)} \right) \right]$$

#### **How the Policy (LLM) is Trained with DPO**

Despite looking complex, this is just a simple **binary classification loss**. Here's how it works:

1.  Take a preference pair: a prompt $x$, a winning response $y\_w$, and a losing response $y\_l$.
2.  Calculate how likely the current policy $\\pi\_\\theta$ is to generate the winner, and how likely it is to generate the loser. Do the same for the frozen reference model $\\pi\_{ref}$.
3.  The loss function's goal is to **maximize the gap** between the log-probability ratio of the winner and the log-probability ratio of the loser.
4.  **Backpropagation:** The gradient of this loss is computed with respect to the policy's parameters ($\\theta$). This gradient directly updates the LLM's weights to increase the probability of generating `y_w` while decreasing the probability of generating `y_l`, all while being regularized by the reference model $\\pi\_{ref}$.

DPO is faster, more stable, and requires only two models (the policy being trained and the frozen reference), making it the new standard for preference alignment.

-----

### **Part 5: Backpropagation - The Engine of Learning**

How does the model *actually* learn from these loss functions? The answer is backpropagation, driven by gradient descent.

  * **Gradient Descent Intuition:** Imagine the loss function defines a vast, hilly landscape, where lower altitude means a better model. Our model's current parameters place it somewhere on this landscape. Gradient descent is the process of feeling which way is downhill (by calculating the gradient) and taking a small step in that direction. Backpropagation is the algorithm for efficiently calculating that gradient for every parameter in a deep neural network.

  * **In SFT:** This is simple. The error is the difference between the predicted next word and the actual word. The gradient is a direct measure of this error and flows cleanly back through the network.

  * **In PPO:** This is far more complex. The "error" (the PPO objective) is calculated from the outputs of four different models. The gradient must be backpropagated through the **Actor** model's generation process. It's an exercise in **credit assignment**: if the final reward was high, backpropagation figures out how to assign "credit" to each token-generation action along the way, strengthening the weights that led to good outcomes.

  * **In DPO:** This is elegantly simple again. The loss is calculated after two forward passes (one for $y\_w$ and one for $y\_l$) through both the active policy and the frozen reference model. The gradient then flows back *only* through the active policy's computations, updating its weights to better classify the preference pair.

-----

### **Part 6: The Complete Workflow and Code**

#### **Full Training Pipeline (DPO-centric)**

1.  **Prerequisites:** A large, pre-trained base LLM (e.g., Llama-2 7B).
2.  **Stage 1 (SFT):** Fine-tune the base LLM on a high-quality dataset of `(prompt, response)` demonstrations. **Result: $\\pi\_{ref}$**.
3.  **Stage 2 (DPO):**
      * Initialize a new model, $\\pi\_{\\theta}$, with the weights from the SFT model.
      * Use a human preference dataset of `(prompt, y_w, y_l)`.
      * Train $\\pi\_{\\theta}$ using the DPO loss function, keeping $\\pi\_{ref}$ frozen.
      * **Result: $\\pi\_{DPO}$**, the final aligned model.

#### **Inference**

When training is done, you only need the final model.

1.  Load the weights for $\\pi\_{DPO}$.
2.  Provide a user prompt.
3.  Generate a response using a decoding method like nucleus sampling. The Critic, RM, and Reference models are no longer needed.

#### **Code Snippets (using Hugging Face TRL)**

The `trl` library makes this process incredibly accessible.
