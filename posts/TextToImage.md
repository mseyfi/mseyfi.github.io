These models represent significant advancements in the field of text-to-image generation. Early models primarily used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to map textual descriptions to images. Over time, researchers incorporated attention mechanisms, contrastive learning, and transformer architectures to enhance the semantic alignment between text and images.

More recent approaches have shifted towards diffusion models, which iteratively refine images by modeling the denoising process. Models like DALL·E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion leverage large-scale training and advanced architectures to generate high-resolution, photorealistic images that closely match the input text.
