Great! Here's a structured learning path for basic machine learning, starting from foundational concepts and progressing through classic algorithms like decision trees, SVMs, and random forests. Each step builds on the previous one:

---

### ðŸ§  **Step-by-Step ML Learning Path (Beginner to Intermediate)**

---

#### **1. Basics of Machine Learning**

* What is Machine Learning? (vs AI vs Deep Learning)
* Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
* Common ML pipeline: data â†’ preprocessing â†’ model â†’ evaluation

---

#### **2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

* Train/Test/Validation split
* Feature scaling: normalization vs standardization
* Encoding categorical variables: one-hot, label encoding
* Handling missing values, outliers

---

#### **3. Supervised Learning Fundamentals**

* **Linear Regression** (for continuous output)

  * Cost function, gradient descent, overfitting/underfitting
* **Logistic Regression** (for classification)

  * Sigmoid function, decision boundaries, regularization

---

#### **4. Decision-Based Models**

* **Decision Trees**

  * Splitting criteria: Gini index, entropy/information gain
  * Tree depth, pruning to prevent overfitting
* **Random Forests**

  * Bagging, ensemble learning, out-of-bag error
  * Feature importance
* **Gradient Boosted Trees** (later in intermediate stage)

  * Difference from random forests

---

#### **5. Distance-Based Models**

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

  * Euclidean distance, choosing K
  * Curse of dimensionality

---

#### **6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

* Margin maximization, decision boundary
* Kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial)
* Hard vs soft margin
* Computational challenges in large datasets

---

#### **7. Model Evaluation**

* Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
* Confusion matrix
* ROC, AUC
* Cross-validation

---

#### **8. Unsupervised Learning (Intro)**

* **Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical**
* **Dimensionality Reduction: PCA**

---

#### **9. Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization**

* Grid search, random search
* Bias-variance tradeoff
* Cross-validation strategies (K-Fold, Stratified)

---

#### **10. Project-Based Learning**

* Start applying models to real datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI)
* Classification projects: spam detection, sentiment analysis
* Regression projects: housing price prediction
