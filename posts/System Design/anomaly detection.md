This is a **classic case of train-validation-test domain shift**, commonly observed in industrial defect detection systems. Your model performs well on your validation dataset (likely from clean or curated data), but fails in the real factory setup. Here's a structured approach to diagnosing and fixing it.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Domain Shift**

* **Lighting conditions** (harsh shadows, reflections, inconsistent exposure)
* **Camera differences** (resolution, lens distortion, focus, noise)
* **Product variations** (small differences in textures, colors, shapes)
* **Different defect types or frequencies** in real data
* **Background clutter** or **motion blur**

### 2. **Overfitting to Validation Set**

* Your validation set might be too similar to the training set.
* You might be testing on patches/images that are manually cleaned, centered, or normalized.

### 3. **Class Imbalance or Labeling Drift**

* Defect types might be **rare or underrepresented** in training.
* Labels in the real factory may **not match** the assumptions made during training (e.g., missing defect boundaries, new defect types).

## üß™ What to Explore

### A. **Real-vs-Validation Distribution Gap**

Use **embedding visualization** (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) to compare:

```python
# Example using embeddings from a CNN backbone
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
real_embed = model.extract_features(factory_images)
val_embed = model.extract_features(validation_images)
embeddings = np.concatenate([real_embed, val_embed])
labels = ['factory'] * len(real_embed) + ['val'] * len(val_embed)
# Plot t-SNE to see if they cluster separately
```

### B. **Visual Error Analysis**

Manually inspect the **false positives and false negatives**:

* What kinds of defects are missed?
* Are background artifacts confusing the model?
* Are non-defect regions being misclassified?

### C. **Augmentation Mismatch**

Check if your augmentations reflect **factory variation**:

* Random lighting
* Motion blur
* Partial occlusions
* Low contrast
* Specular highlights

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It

### 1. **Domain Adaptation Techniques**

#### A. *Data-centric fixes*

* Collect **real factory data**, even if unlabeled
* Use **self-supervised pretraining** (e.g., MoCo, SimCLR, DINO) on factory images to initialize the backbone
* Add **hard samples** (false positives/negatives from factory) into retraining

#### B. *Model-centric fixes*

* **Fine-tune** on a small labeled subset of real factory data
* Apply **unsupervised domain adaptation** (e.g., CORAL, MMD loss)
* Use **domain generalization methods** like MixStyle, RandAugment, or Tent

### 2. **Rebalancing & Curriculum Learning**

* Add more defect types or underrepresented classes
* Use **focal loss** or **class-balanced loss**
* Start training on easy examples, then introduce harder (factory) cases

### 3. **Better Data Pipelines**

* Normalize images **with factory-specific statistics** (mean/std from factory)
* Apply **domain-specific augmentations** (e.g., Gaussian blur, JPEG compression)
* Use test-time augmentation (TTA) during inference

## üìà Evaluation Protocol Fix

* Split real factory data into **pseudo-validation**, **calibration**, and **test** buckets.
* Perform **cross-domain validation** (train on lab, validate on factory).
* Try **cross-camera, cross-time validation** to simulate shift.

## ‚úÖ Summary: Actions to Take

| Category          | Actions                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data**          | Collect hard cases from factory, augment with real-world noise      |
| **Model**         | Fine-tune on real samples, apply domain adaptation                  |
| **Validation**    | Redefine validation strategy to include factory images              |
| **Augmentation**  | Use domain-relevant augmentations (blur, lighting, occlusion, etc.) |
| **Loss Function** | Try focal loss, mixup, or uncertainty-aware losses                  |

If you can share specific details (e.g., defect types, training vs. real data samples, model type), I can tailor these recommendations further.
