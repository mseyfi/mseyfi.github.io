This is a **classic case of train-validation-test domain shift**, commonly observed in industrial defect detection systems. Your model performs well on your validation dataset (likely from clean or curated data), but fails in the real factory setup. Here's a structured approach to diagnosing and fixing it.

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Domain Shift**

* **Lighting conditions** (harsh shadows, reflections, inconsistent exposure)
* **Camera differences** (resolution, lens distortion, focus, noise)
* **Product variations** (small differences in textures, colors, shapes)
* **Different defect types or frequencies** in real data
* **Background clutter** or **motion blur**

### 2. **Overfitting to Validation Set**

* Your validation set might be too similar to the training set.
* You might be testing on patches/images that are manually cleaned, centered, or normalized.

### 3. **Class Imbalance or Labeling Drift**

* Defect types might be **rare or underrepresented** in training.
* Labels in the real factory may **not match** the assumptions made during training (e.g., missing defect boundaries, new defect types).

---

## üß™ What to Explore

### A. **Real-vs-Validation Distribution Gap**

Use **embedding visualization** (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) to compare:

```python
# Example using embeddings from a CNN backbone
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
real_embed = model.extract_features(factory_images)
val_embed = model.extract_features(validation_images)
embeddings = np.concatenate([real_embed, val_embed])
labels = ['factory'] * len(real_embed) + ['val'] * len(val_embed)
# Plot t-SNE to see if they cluster separately
```

### B. **Visual Error Analysis**

Manually inspect the **false positives and false negatives**:

* What kinds of defects are missed?
* Are background artifacts confusing the model?
* Are non-defect regions being misclassified?

### C. **Augmentation Mismatch**

Check if your augmentations reflect **factory variation**:

* Random lighting
* Motion blur
* Partial occlusions
* Low contrast
* Specular highlights

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It

### 1. **Domain Adaptation Techniques**

#### A. *Data-centric fixes*

* Collect **real factory data**, even if unlabeled
* Use **self-supervised pretraining** (e.g., MoCo, SimCLR, DINO) on factory images to initialize the backbone
* Add **hard samples** (false positives/negatives from factory) into retraining

#### B. *Model-centric fixes*

* **Fine-tune** on a small labeled subset of real factory data
* Apply **unsupervised domain adaptation** (e.g., CORAL, MMD loss)
* Use **domain generalization methods** like MixStyle, RandAugment, or Tent

### 2. **Rebalancing & Curriculum Learning**

* Add more defect types or underrepresented classes
* Use **focal loss** or **class-balanced loss**
* Start training on easy examples, then introduce harder (factory) cases

### 3. **Better Data Pipelines**

* Normalize images **with factory-specific statistics** (mean/std from factory)
* Apply **domain-specific augmentations** (e.g., Gaussian blur, JPEG compression)
* Use test-time augmentation (TTA) during inference

---

## üìà Evaluation Protocol Fix

* Split real factory data into **pseudo-validation**, **calibration**, and **test** buckets.
* Perform **cross-domain validation** (train on lab, validate on factory).
* Try **cross-camera, cross-time validation** to simulate shift.

If you can share specific details (e.g., defect types, training vs. real data samples, model type), I can tailor these recommendations further.





Certainly. Let‚Äôs go deep into **Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)**, especially in the context of **image-based defect detection**. You'll get:

* The problem setup
* Mathematical formulation
* Key UDA techniques
* Example methods with intuition
* Implementation strategies

---

## üîß Problem Setup

You have:

* **Source domain**: labeled training data
  $$\mathcal{D}_S = \{(x_i^S, y_i^S)\}_{i=1}^N$$

* **Target domain**: **unlabeled** test (factory) data
  $$\mathcal{D}_T = \{x_j^T\}_{j=1}^M$$

Both domains have **different distributions**:

$$
P_S(x, y) \ne P_T(x, y)
$$

But your goal is to train a model that performs **well on the target domain**, even though you don‚Äôt have target labels.

---

## üìê Objective of UDA

Learn a model $f(x) = y$ such that:

* It performs well on source ($\mathcal{D}_S$)
* It **generalizes** to target ($\mathcal{D}_T$)

This is done by **aligning feature distributions** between source and target so that the classifier trained on source features can work on target features.

---

## üß† Core UDA Strategies

UDA techniques can be categorized into 3 major approaches:

---

### 1. **Feature Alignment**

The goal is to make the **feature distributions** of source and target match.

#### A. **Domain Adversarial Training (DANN)**

**Idea**: Use a domain classifier to distinguish source vs target features, and confuse it with a feature extractor.

**Architecture**:

```
Image -> Feature Extractor -> (1) Classifier
                              (2) Domain Discriminator
```

* Use **gradient reversal layer (GRL)** to reverse gradients from the domain discriminator.
* Objective:

  $$
  \min_{F,C} \max_D \left[ L_{\text{cls}}(C(F(x^S)), y^S) - \lambda L_{\text{dom}}(D(F(x)), d) \right]
  $$

  where $d=0$ for source, $d=1$ for target.

This forces the feature extractor $F$ to learn **domain-invariant** representations.

#### B. **CORAL (CORrelation ALignment)**

Match **second-order statistics** (covariances) between source and target:

$$
\text{CORAL loss} = \| \text{Cov}(F(x^S)) - \text{Cov}(F(x^T)) \|_F^2
$$

It's simple and effective for aligning distributions.

#### C. **MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy)**

Minimize the **distance between distributions** in RKHS:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \| \mu_S - \mu_T \|_{\mathcal{H}}^2
$$

Where $\mu_S = \mathbb{E}[F(x^S)]$, $\mu_T = \mathbb{E}[F(x^T)]$.

Used in methods like **Deep Adaptation Networks (DAN)**.

---

### 2. **Self-Supervised Learning on Target**

Even if the target has no labels, you can **pretrain** or co-train the feature extractor using self-supervised tasks:

* Rotation prediction
* Jigsaw puzzles
* BYOL, SimCLR, MoCo
* DINO (for vision transformers)

This helps **structure the feature space** on the target domain, improving generalization.

---

### 3. **Pseudo-Labeling**

Assign pseudo-labels to confident target predictions and **retrain** the model:

1. Predict $\hat{y}_j = f(x_j^T)$
2. Pick confident examples: $\max(\hat{y}_j) > \tau$
3. Train on $(x_j^T, \hat{y}_j)$ as if labeled

Refine pseudo-labels iteratively (**self-training**).

---

## üèó Example: DANN (Domain Adversarial Neural Network)

```python
class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        ...
    def forward(self, x): return features

class ClassClassifier(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, features): return logits

class DomainClassifier(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, features): return domain_logits

class GRL(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x): return x.view_as(x)
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output): return -grad_output
```

Training loop:

```python
features = extractor(input)
class_output = class_classifier(features)
domain_output = domain_classifier(GRL.apply(features))

# Losses
loss_class = CE(class_output, label)
loss_domain = BCE(domain_output, domain_label)
loss_total = loss_class + Œª * loss_domain
```

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics for UDA

* **Target accuracy (if you have few labels for evaluation)**
* **t-SNE plots** of source and target embeddings
* **Domain classifier accuracy** (ideally should be \~50%)

# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

If your factory setup differs a lot (e.g., different lighting or background), **DANN or CORAL + self-supervised pretraining** is often the most effective combo.
