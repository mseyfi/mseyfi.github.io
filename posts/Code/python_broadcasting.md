**rules for broadcasting in Python (NumPy):**

## ✅ Broadcasting: 3 Golden Rules

### 🔹 Rule 1: Compare from **trailing dimensions**

Start from the **rightmost dimension**, and work left. Dimensions are compatible if:

* they are equal, or
* one of them is 1

### 🔹 Rule 2: **Missing dimensions are treated as 1**

If arrays have different numbers of dimensions, the smaller one is **left-padded** with 1s.

### 🔹 Rule 3: Expand size 1 to match

If a dimension is 1 in one array and some number $N$ in the other, the 1 is **broadcast (stretched)** to match $N$.

## 🧪 Example

```python
A = np.ones((3, 1))       # shape: (3, 1)
B = np.array([10, 20, 30])  # shape: (3,) → broadcast to (1, 3)
C = A * B  # result shape: (3, 3)
```

### ✅ Why?

* A: (3, 1)
* B: → reshaped to (1, 3)
* Result: dimensions (3, 3)

Yes — let’s break down **broadcasting in Python (NumPy)** into **simple rules** and give **lots of examples**.

---

## 🧪 Examples by Category

---

### 🔸 **Scalar vs Array**

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])      # (3,)
b = 10                       # scalar

a + b  # ➜ [11, 12, 13]      # scalar is broadcast to (3,)
```

---

### 🔸 **1D vs 2D**

```python
a = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])  # (3,1)
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])     # (3,) — becomes (1,3) in broadcast rules

a + b  
# a: (3,1) → broadcast to (3,3)
# b: (1,3) → broadcast to (3,3)
# ➜ 
# [[11, 21, 31],
#  [12, 22, 32],
#  [13, 23, 33]]
```

---

### 🔸 **Matrix + Row Vector**

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])      # shape: (2,3)

row = np.array([10, 20, 30])   # shape: (3,)

A + row
# A: (2,3)
# row: (1,3) → broadcast to (2,3)
# ➜ [[11, 22, 33],
#     [14, 25, 36]]
```

---

### 🔸 **Matrix + Column Vector**

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])      # (2,3)

col = np.array([[10],
                [20]])         # (2,1)

A + col
# col: (2,1) → broadcast to (2,3)
# ➜ [[11, 12, 13],
#     [24, 25, 26]]
```

---

### 🔸 **3D vs 2D**

```python
a = np.ones((2, 1, 3))       # (2,1,3)
b = np.ones((1, 4, 1))       # (1,4,1)

# Resulting shape:
# (2,4,3) by broadcasting:
# a: (2,1,3) → (2,4,3)
# b: (1,4,1) → (2,4,3)
```

---

### ❌ **Broadcasting Fails**

```python
a = np.ones((2, 3))
b = np.ones((4, 2))

a + b  # ERROR: dimension mismatch (3 ≠ 4)
```

---

## 🔁 Shortcut Summary Table

| A shape   | B shape | Result shape | Notes                    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| (3,)      | (3,)    | (3,)         | Elementwise add          |
| (1, 3)    | (3,)    | (1, 3)       | Expand B                 |
| (2, 3)    | (1, 3)  | (2, 3)       | Row broadcast            |
| (2, 3)    | (2, 1)  | (2, 3)       | Column broadcast         |
| (2, 3, 4) | (3, 4)  | (2, 3, 4)    | Prepend 1 to B → (1,3,4) |
| (2, 1, 4) | (3, 1)  | ❌            | Shape mismatch           |

## 🧠 Mental Model: Broadcasting with Axes

If shapes are:

```python
A.shape = (2, 1, 3)
B.shape =     (4, 1)
```

Align from the right:

```
A: (2, 1, 3)
B: (1, 4, 1)
Result: (2, 4, 3)
```

---


Broadcasting works **exactly the same for multiplication** as it does for addition — same rules, same shape expansion — but the **operation is elementwise multiplication**.

---

## ✅ Broadcasting Multiplication Rules

* **Same rules** as for addition:

  1. Align shapes **right to left**
  2. Dimensions must be **equal** or **one of them is 1**
  3. Singleton dimensions are **stretched logically**
* Result shape is the **broadcasted shape**

---

## 🧪 Examples of Broadcasting Multiplication

---

### 🔸 Scalar × Array

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # shape (3,)
b = 10                   # scalar

a * b  # ➜ [10, 20, 30]
```

---

### 🔸 Vector × Vector (Same shape)

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])    # shape (3,)
b = np.array([10, 20, 30]) # shape (3,)

a * b  # ➜ [10, 40, 90]
```

---

### 🔸 Row Vector × Matrix

```python
row = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])               # shape (1, 3)
mat = np.array([[10, 10, 10], [1, 1, 1]]) # shape (2, 3)

mat * row
# row broadcast to (2, 3)
# ➜ [[10, 20, 30],
#     [1, 2, 3]]
```

---

### 🔸 Column Vector × Matrix

```python
col = np.array([[2], [3]])               # shape (2,1)
mat = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [1, 2, 3]])# shape (2,3)

col * mat
# col broadcast to (2,3)
# ➜ [[20, 40, 60],
#     [3, 6, 9]]
```

---

### 🔸 Matrix × Matrix with one expandable dimension

```python
a = np.array([[[1], [2], [3]]])       # shape (1, 3, 1)
b = np.array([[[10, 20, 30]]])        # shape (1, 1, 3)

a * b  # broadcast to shape (1, 3, 3)
# ➜ [[[10, 20, 30],
#      [20, 40, 60],
#      [30, 60, 90]]]
```

---

### ❌ Incompatible shapes

```python
a = np.ones((2, 3))  # shape (2,3)
b = np.ones((4,))    # shape (4,)

a * b  # ❌ Error: cannot broadcast (2,3) with (4,)
```

---

## 📏 Practical Uses of Broadcasting Multiplication

* Apply **scale factors** to each column or row:

```python
# Normalize rows
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])         # (2,2)
row_sums = X.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)  # (2,1)
X_normalized = X / row_sums              # broadcast division (2,2)/(2,1)
```

* Apply a **mask**:

```python
image = np.random.rand(5, 5, 3)  # shape (H, W, C)
mask = np.array([0, 1, 0])       # shape (3,)
result = image * mask            # mask broadcast to (5, 5, 3)
```
