Hereâ€™s a simplified set of **rules for broadcasting in Python (NumPy):**

## âœ… Broadcasting: 3 Golden Rules

### ðŸ”¹ Rule 1: Compare from **trailing dimensions**

Start from the **rightmost dimension**, and work left. Dimensions are compatible if:

* they are equal, or
* one of them is 1

### ðŸ”¹ Rule 2: **Missing dimensions are treated as 1**

If arrays have different numbers of dimensions, the smaller one is **left-padded** with 1s.

### ðŸ”¹ Rule 3: Expand size 1 to match

If a dimension is 1 in one array and some number $N$ in the other, the 1 is **broadcast (stretched)** to match $N$.

## ðŸ§ª Example

```python
A = np.ones((3, 1))       # shape: (3, 1)
B = np.array([10, 20, 30])  # shape: (3,) â†’ broadcast to (1, 3)
C = A * B  # result shape: (3, 3)
```

### âœ… Why?

* A: (3, 1)
* B: â†’ reshaped to (1, 3)
* Result: dimensions (3, 3)
