# Linkedlist node removal. For example when you want to remove the last node in a linkedlist
## üîß Analogy: The Train and the Map

Imagine you are in a **train yard**. Each **train car** is connected to the next using a physical **coupler** (like `.next` in a linked list).

You have:

* A **map** of the train yard (`head`, `prev`, `curr` variables), which tells you where the cars are and how they‚Äôre connected.
* But the **cars themselves are physically connected** ‚Äî the map doesn‚Äôt change the connections unless you **manually uncouple** two cars.

---

## üöÇ Scenario

Let‚Äôs say we have:

```
car1 ‚Üí car2 ‚Üí car3 ‚Üí car4
```

and your map has:

```python
curr = car4
prev = car3
```

You want to **remove car4**, because it‚Äôs a duplicate.

---

### ‚ùå What You Did: `curr = None`

That‚Äôs like **erasing `car4` from your personal map** ‚Äî you forget where it is.

BUT ‚Äî you **did not uncouple** `car3.next` from `car4`. The physical coupler still links `car3 ‚Üí car4`. So car4 is still on the track!

Even worse, when someone asks for the full train starting at `car1`, it still drives through to `car4`.

---

### ‚úÖ What You Should Do: `prev.next = None`

This is like **reaching down and actually uncoupling** the connector between `car3` and `car4`. Now the train really ends at `car3`.

Your map (`curr`, `prev`) can be forgotten, but the **real structure** of the train is modified.

---

## üî¨ Python Pointer Behavior

Now in Python terms:

* `curr = None` just reassigns the **local variable** `curr`. It has no effect on the object that `curr` used to point to.
* `prev.next = None` **modifies the linked structure** (i.e., the actual field of the node).

This is true for all Python objects ‚Äî you have to change the field on the object, not just reassign the variable pointing to it.

---

## üß† Bottom Line

* **Variables (like `curr`) are just labels** ‚Äî if you lose a label, the object still exists (like car4 still being on the train).
* To **change the linked list**, you must change the `.next` fields (the couplers between the train cars).
* `curr = None` is like forgetting where a car is. It does not remove it.
* `prev.next = None` is like detaching the car from the train ‚Äî now it's truly gone from the list.

## ‚úÖ YES: `curr` points to the address of the last node

When you have this:

```python
curr = some_node
```

Then `curr` holds a **reference** (think of it as a pointer or memory address) to a `ListNode` object in the heap.

---

## ‚úÖ YES: `curr = None` just removes the reference

This line:

```python
curr = None
```

means you **stop pointing** to that node. But the node is **still there** in memory **if other variables still point to it**.

In Python, the object stays alive as long as **someone holds a reference** to it.

So if the list is:

```
node1 ‚Üí node2 ‚Üí node3
```

and `curr = node3`, then:

* `curr = None` forgets node3 **only from the `curr` variable**
* But `node2.next` still points to `node3` ‚Äî so the node is still reachable

---

## üß† So how does Python **delete** objects?

Python uses **automatic garbage collection** based on **reference counting**:

* When no variables (including fields like `node.next`) refer to an object anymore,
* Python will automatically delete the object (free the memory).

So, to *delete* a node:

### ‚ùå You **cannot** explicitly free memory in Python like in C/C++

### ‚úÖ You must **break all references to it**

To "delete" a node in a linked list, do this:

```python
prev.next = curr.next
curr = None
```

This does two things:

1. The node is **removed from the linked structure** (no `.next` field points to it anymore).
2. If there are **no other references** to that node, Python will **automatically garbage collect it**.

---

## üî¨ Minimal Example

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

a = Node(1)
b = Node(2)
a.next = b     # a ‚Üí b
```

Now:

```python
b = None       # removes *your* reference to node b
```

But `a.next` still points to that node.

So you must do:

```python
a.next = None  # disconnect it
b = None       # drop your own reference
```

Now nobody refers to that node ‚Üí Python deletes it from memory.

| Action                  | Effect                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `curr = None`           | Only forgets the node in this variable. List unchanged. |
| `prev.next = curr.next` | Removes the node from the linked list.                  |
| Object deleted?         | Only when **no references** exist to it anymore.        |
| Manual delete?          | Not possible. Let Python garbage collect it.            |
