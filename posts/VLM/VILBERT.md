### **ViLBERT: Pretraining Task-Agnostic Visiolinguistic Representations**

This tutorial breaks down the ViLBERT model, a seminal work in vision-and-language pre-training.

-----

### **1\. The Intuition: What Problem Does ViLBERT Solve?**

Before ViLBERT, models for tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) or Image Captioning were often trained from scratch for that specific task. This required large, task-specific labeled datasets and didn't leverage knowledge from other related tasks.

The core idea of ViLBERT is inspired by the success of **BERT** in Natural Language Processing (NLP). BERT is pre-trained on a massive amount of text data with self-supervised objectives (like guessing masked words). This allows it to learn a deep, general-purpose understanding of language, which can then be quickly **fine-tuned** for various downstream tasks (like sentiment analysis or question answering).

ViLBERT extends this "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm to vision-and-language. The goal is to create a model that learns a fundamental, shared representation of visual and textual concepts from large, unlabeled datasets of image-text pairs. This pre-trained model can then be adapted to solve a wide range of vision-and-language tasks with minimal additional training.

The key innovation is how it processes both modalities. Instead of just mushing the image and text information together from the start, ViLBERT uses a **two-stream architecture**. Imagine two separate "experts": one that reads text and one that looks at images. They first process their own input independently and then communicate back and forth to build a joint understanding.

-----

### **2\. Model Architecture**

ViLBERT consists of two parallel BERT-style Transformer networksâ€”one for processing text (the linguistic stream) and one for processing regions in an image (the visual stream). These streams interact through a series of novel "co-attentional transformer layers."

#### **a. Overall Structure**

  * **Two-Stream Design:** A linguistic stream and a visual stream.
  * **Linguistic Stream:** A standard Transformer encoder.
  * **Visual Stream:** A Transformer encoder that operates on image region features.
  * **Co-Attentional Layers:** Special layers that allow information exchange between the two streams.

#### **b. Input Representation**

A single training instance for ViLBERT is an (image, text) pair.

  * **Text Input:** The text is processed just like in BERT.

      * A special `[CLS]` token is prepended to the sentence.
      * A `[SEP]` token marks the end.
      * The sentence is tokenized into WordPieces.
      * The final input embedding for each token is the sum of its **token embedding**, **segment embedding**, and **position embedding**.

  * **Image Input:** The model doesn't see raw pixels. Instead, it sees a set of objects or salient regions from the image.

    1.  **Object Detection:** A pre-trained object detector (like Faster R-CNN) is run on the image to identify salient regions (e.g., "car", "person", "tree").
    2.  **Region Feature Extraction:** For each detected region, a feature vector is extracted. This vector represents the visual appearance of that region.
    3.  **Positional Encoding:** The bounding box coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` for each region are encoded into a 5-dimensional vector to give the model spatial awareness.
    4.  A special `[IMG]` token is added to the sequence of regions, which acts as a summary of the entire image, analogous to the `[CLS]` token for text.

So, the input to the visual stream is a sequence of region features, and the input to the linguistic stream is a sequence of word embeddings.

#### ****c. Co-Attentional Transformer Layer**

This is the core of ViLBERT. A standard Transformer layer consists of a Multi-Head Self-Attention module followed by a Feed-Forward Network. In ViLBERT's **co-attentional** layers, the attention mechanism is modified to allow one stream to attend to the other.

Let's denote the hidden states from the visual stream as $H\_V$ and from the linguistic stream as $H\_L$.

A single co-attentional transformer block works as follows:

1.  **Multi-Head Co-Attention:**

      * The visual stream calculates its new representations by attending to the language stream. The queries ($Q\_V$) come from the visual stream, but the keys ($K\_L$) and values ($V\_L$) come from the linguistic stream. This lets each image region "ask" the text: "Which words are most relevant to me?"
      * Simultaneously, the linguistic stream attends to the visual stream. The queries ($Q\_L$) come from the linguistic stream, and the keys ($K\_V$) and values ($V\_V$) come from the visual stream. This lets each word "ask" the image: "Which regions are most relevant to me?"

2.  **Feed-Forward Networks:** After the co-attention step, the updated hidden states in each stream are passed through their own separate Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), just like in a standard Transformer.

This block is stacked multiple times, allowing for deep and iterative fusion of information.

-----

### **3\. Mathematics of Co-Attention**

The fundamental building block is Scaled Dot-Product Attention:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where $Q$ is the query, $K$ is the key, $V$ is the value, and $d\_k$ is the dimension of the key.

In a **Co-Attentional Layer**, let $H\_L^{(i-1)}$ and $H\_V^{(i-1)}$ be the outputs of the previous layer for the linguistic and visual streams, respectively.

The new intermediate hidden states ($H\prime^\start_{L}$ and $H\prime^\start_{V}$) are calculated via multi-head co-attention:

$$
H'_{L} = \text{Co-Attention}(Q=H_L^{(i-1)}, K=H_V^{(i-1)}, V=H_V^{(i-1)})
$$

$$
H'_{V} = \text{Co-Attention}(Q=H_V^{(i-1)}, K=H_L^{(i-1)}, V=H_L^{(i-1)})
$$

After attention, Layer Normalization and residual connections are applied, followed by a standard Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN) for each stream separately to get the final outputs $H\_L^{(i)}$ and $H\_V^{(i)}$.

$$
H_L^{(i)} = \text{FFN}_L(\text{LayerNorm}(H_L^{(i-1)} + H'_{L}))
$$

$$
H_V^{(i)} = \text{FFN}_V(\text{LayerNorm}(H_V^{(i-1)} + H'_{V}))
$$

### **4\. Pre-training Tasks and Loss Functions**

ViLBERT is pre-trained on the large Conceptual Captions dataset using two main tasks. The goal is to force the model to learn a strong alignment between vision and language.

#### **Task 1: Masked Multi-Modal Modelling**

This is analogous to the Masked Language Model task in BERT, but applied to both modalities. Given an (image, text) pair, we randomly mask some input tokens in both streams with a 15% probability.

  * **Masking Words:** A masked word token is replaced with a `[MASK]` token. The model must predict the original word.

      * **Loss Function ($L\_{MLM}$):** The standard Cross-Entropy loss over the vocabulary for the masked words. If $\\theta$ are the model parameters and $w\_{masked}$ are the masked words, we want to minimize the negative log-probability of the correct word $w^\*$:

        $$
        L_{MLM} = -\sum_{w \in w_{masked}} \log P(w=w^* | \text{Image}, \text{Text}_{masked}; \theta)
        $$

  * **Masking Image Regions:** A masked image region's features are replaced with zeros. The model must then predict the semantic class of that region and also reconstruct its features.

      * **Loss Function ($L\_{MRC}$ - Masked Region Classification):** A Cross-Entropy loss over the distribution of object classes from the object detector. The model has to predict what kind of object was in the masked region.

        $$
        L_{MRC} = -\sum_{r \in r_{masked}} \log P(c=c^* | \text{Image}_{masked}, \text{Text}; \theta)
        $$
        
        where $c^\*$ is the ground-truth class for the masked region $r$.

      * **Loss Function ($L\_{MRFR}$ - Masked Region Feature Regression):** The L2 distance between the model's predicted feature vector for the masked region and the actual feature vector from the RoI detector. This ensures the model learns fine-grained visual details.

        $$
        L_{MRFR} = \sum_{r \in r_{masked}} || f(r) - f(r)^* ||_2^2
        $$
        
        where $f(r)$ is the predicted feature vector and $f(r)^\*$ is the ground-truth.

#### **Task 2: Vision-Language Alignment**

This task teaches the model to understand if a sentence and an image truly belong together.

  * **Procedure:** Given an (image, text) pair, 50% of the time it's the correct, aligned pair. For the other 50%, the text is replaced with a random caption from another image.
  * **Prediction:** The final hidden states corresponding to the `[CLS]` token (from text) and the `[IMG]` token (from image) are concatenated and passed through a simple linear classifier to predict `[Aligned]` or `[Not Aligned]`.
  * **Loss Function ($L\_{VLA}$):** A Binary Cross-Entropy loss for this classification task.

    $$
    L_{VLA} = - y \log p - (1-y) \log(1-p)
    $$
    
    where $y=1$ for an aligned pair and $y=0$ for a misaligned pair, and $p$ is the model's predicted probability of alignment.

#### **Total Pre-training Loss**

The total loss is simply the sum of the individual losses:

$$
L_{TOTAL} = L_{MLM} + L_{MRC} + L_{MRFR} + L_{VLA}
$$

-----

### **5\. Fine-Tuning and Inference**

After pre-training, the model has learned powerful, generic visiolinguistic representations. To solve a specific task, we adapt it.

  * **Process:** Remove the pre-training heads (e.g., the MLM predictor, the alignment classifier). Add a new, small, task-specific output layer. Then, fine-tune the entire model's weights on the labeled data for the new task.

#### **Sample Inference Tasks:**

1.  **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**

      * **Input:** An image and a question (e.g., "What color is the hydrant?").
      * **How it works:** The image regions and the question are fed into the ViLBERT model. The final output representation (e.g., from the `[CLS]` token) is fed into a new classifier layer that predicts an answer from a predefined set of common answers (e.g., "red", "blue", "yellow").
      * **Output:** The most likely answer (e.g., "red").

2.  **Referring Expression Comprehension**

      * **Input:** An image and a textual description of an object (e.g., "the man holding a briefcase").
      * **How it works:** The image regions and text are processed. The model then computes an alignment score between the text's final representation and each of the image region's final representations. The region with the highest score is chosen.
      * **Output:** A bounding box corresponding to the described object.

3.  **Image-Text Retrieval**

      * **Input:** A query image and a gallery of candidate captions.
      * **How it works:** The ViLBERT model processes the image and each caption individually. The vision-language alignment head is used to calculate an alignment score for each (image, caption) pair.
      * **Output:** The caption with the highest alignment score.
