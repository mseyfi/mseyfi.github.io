# Mixed Precision Training: An In-Depth Explanation

## What Is Mixed Precision Training?

**Mixed precision training** is a technique used in deep learning to accelerate training and reduce memory consumption by utilizing both single-precision (32-bit, `FP32`) and half-precision (16-bit, `FP16`) floating-point formats. The primary goal is to leverage the computational speed and memory efficiency of lower-precision arithmetic while maintaining the model's accuracy and stability.

Modern GPUs, such as NVIDIA's Tensor Cores, are optimized for half-precision computations, offering significant speedups for operations performed in `FP16`. However, using `FP16` exclusively can lead to numerical issues due to its limited precision and dynamic range. Mixed precision training strategically combines `FP16` and `FP32` to overcome these challenges.

## Which Layers Use Lower and Higher Precision, and Why?

### Lower Precision (`FP16`)

- **Weights and Activations in Forward Pass**: Most of the model's weights and activations are stored and computed in `FP16` during the forward pass.
- **Matrix Multiplications and Convolutions**: Computationally intensive operations like matrix multiplications and convolutions are performed in `FP16` to exploit hardware acceleration.

### Higher Precision (`FP32`)

- **Master Weights**: A master copy of the model's weights is kept in `FP32` to preserve precision during weight updates.
- **Accumulation of Gradients**: Gradient computations and accumulations during backpropagation are performed in `FP32` to prevent numerical underflow and overflow.
- **Loss Scaling Factors**: Scaling factors used for loss scaling are maintained in `FP32` to ensure accurate scaling and unscaling.

### **Why This Division?**

- **Numerical Stability**: Certain operations, like gradient calculations and weight updates, are sensitive to precision loss. Using `FP32` for these ensures numerical stability.
- **Performance Optimization**: By performing less sensitive operations in `FP16`, we gain computational speed and reduce memory usage without significantly affecting model accuracy.
- **Dynamic Range**: `FP16` has a smaller dynamic range compared to `FP32`. Accumulating small gradient values in `FP16` can lead to underflow (values becoming zero), hence the need for `FP32` in these cases.

## How It Works in Practice

### Mathematical Operations in Mixed Precision Training

1. **Forward Pass**:

   - **Autocasting**: Inputs and model parameters are cast to `FP16` where safe to do so.
   - **Computation**: Operations like convolutions and matrix multiplications are performed in `FP16`.
   - **Master Weights**: Despite computations in `FP16`, the master copy of weights remains in `FP32`.

2. **Backward Pass**:

   - **Gradient Computation**: Gradients are initially computed in `FP16`.
   - **Gradient Accumulation**: Gradients are accumulated in `FP32` to avoid underflow.
   - **Weight Updates**: The optimizer updates the `FP32` master weights using the `FP32` gradients.

3. **Weight Casting**:

   - After the optimizer step, the updated `FP32` master weights are cast back to `FP16` for the next forward pass.

### Understanding Gradient Underflow

**Gradient underflow** occurs when gradient values become so small that they fall below the minimum representable number in `FP16` (approximately \(6 \times 10^{-8}\)). When this happens, the gradients effectively become zero, impeding the learning process because the weights no longer receive meaningful updates.

**Mathematically**, if $$g$$ is a gradient value and $$g \le\text{FP16}_\text{min}$$, then in `FP16`, $$g = 0$$. This loss of information halts training progress.

## Why Do We Need to Scale the Loss?

**Loss scaling** is a technique used to prevent gradient underflow in mixed precision training. By multiplying the loss value by a large scaling factor before backpropagation, we proportionally increase the gradients, ensuring they stay within the representable range of `FP16`.

### Mathematical Explanation

Let:

- $$L$$: Original loss value.
- $$S$$: Scaling factor (e.g., 1024, 65536).
- $$\tilde{L} = L \times S$$: Scaled loss.

**Backpropagation with Scaled Loss**:

1. **Compute Scaled Gradients**:

   $$
   \tilde{g} = \frac{\partial \tilde{L}}{\partial w} = S \times \frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = S \times g
   $$

   Where $$g$$ is the original gradient.

2. **Unscale Gradients**:

   Before the optimizer step, divide the gradients by $$S$$ to bring them back to the correct scale:

   $$
   g_{\text{unscaled}} = \frac{\tilde{g}}{S} = \frac{S \times g}{S} = g
   $$

### Why Is This Necessary?

- **Prevent Underflow**: Scaling ensures that small gradients don't become zero in `FP16`.
- **Maintain Correct Gradient Magnitudes**: Unscaling before the optimizer step ensures that the weight updates are based on the true gradients.

## Autocast, Loss Scaling, and Gradient Scaler in Practice

### Autocast

**Autocast** is a context manager provided by libraries like PyTorch (`torch.cuda.amp.autocast`) that automatically casts operations to the appropriate precision:

- **Within Autocast Block**:

  - Operations are performed in `FP16` if they are deemed safe and beneficial for performance.
  - Certain operations that are sensitive to precision are kept in `FP32` automatically.

**Example**:

```python
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    outputs = model(inputs)  # Operations are performed in mixed precision
```

### Loss Scaling and Gradient Scaler

**Gradient Scaler** (`torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler`) manages loss scaling:

1. **Scale the Loss**:

   ```python
   scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()
   with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
       outputs = model(inputs)
       loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
   scaled_loss = scaler.scale(loss)
   ```

   The `GradScaler` scales the loss internally.

2. **Backpropagation**:

   ```python
   scaled_loss.backward()
   ```

   Gradients are computed with respect to the scaled loss.

3. **Unscale Gradients and Step Optimizer**:

   ```python
   scaler.step(optimizer)
   scaler.update()
   ```

   - **`scaler.step(optimizer)`**: Before the optimizer step, `GradScaler` unscales the gradients, applies `inf/nan` checks, and updates the weights.
   - **`scaler.update()`**: Adjusts the scaling factor dynamically based on whether overflows occurred during the backward pass.

### Why Use `GradScaler`?

- **Automated Loss Scaling**: Manages scaling without manual intervention.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Automatically increases or decreases the scaling factor to maximize the usable dynamic range without causing overflow.

## Difference Between Mixed Precision Training and Quantization Aware Training (QAT)

### Mixed Precision Training

- **Objective**: Accelerate training and reduce memory usage by using both `FP16` and `FP32` precisions during training.
- **Precision Types**: Involves floating-point formats (`FP16` and `FP32`).
- **Key Features**:

  - Uses hardware capabilities to speed up computations.
  - Requires loss scaling to prevent gradient underflow.
  - Maintains a master copy of weights in `FP32`.

- **Training Modifications**: Adjusts data types and employs loss scaling but does not alter the model architecture or introduce quantization nodes.

### Quantization Aware Training (QAT)

- **Objective**: Prepare the model for low-precision inference (e.g., `INT8`) by simulating quantization effects during training.
- **Precision Types**: Involves integer formats (`INT8`, `INT4`) and fixed-point arithmetic.
- **Key Features**:

  - Introduces fake quantization modules (`QuantStub`, `DeQuantStub`) in the model.
  - Simulates the effects of quantization noise during training.
  - Aims to maintain model accuracy after quantization.

- **Training Modifications**: Alters the model architecture to include quantization and dequantization operations, affecting how data flows through the network.

        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize model, loss function, optimizer, and scaler
model = SimpleModel().cuda()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
scaler = GradScaler()

# Training loop with mixed precision
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
        inputs = inputs.cuda()
        targets = targets.cuda()
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward pass with autocast
        with autocast():
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        
        # Scales the loss, calls backward()
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()
        
        # scaler.step() unscales the gradients and updates weights
        scaler.step(optimizer)
        # Updates the scale for next iteration
        scaler.update()
```
