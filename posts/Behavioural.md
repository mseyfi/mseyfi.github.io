> [!note]
> I was on PTO and I checked a post on Meta Rayban Dogfooding that people complained about dark faces in backlit scenatios.(*Situation*). We had to enable Face Detection for Snapshot mode(*Task*). We could not enable face detection for snapshot because our model was based on cpu and we had to export the model to DSP in order to be able run the model every frame. But for that there were many technical issues we had to solve (talk about operators that was not supported. Compatibility to DSP, We had to engage cross functional teams to be able to load the dsp model to software stack. (*Action*) We could manage to deliver the model on time. (*Result*) I was on PTO and I did not have any resposiblity to check the blogs and reports. I did not check with my manager because she was on PTO as well.
### Ownership Section
- #### Give me two instances when you went above and beyond what was expected of you?
   - **DSP model** *just explained above*
   - **Gesture detection dataset** *We did not have data, I had a time sensative task, escalated to th eleadership, I assigned multiple people to the task, Wrot edocumentation how to capture and classify the images in sperate fodder. I asked my familly as well to be involved in collecting data, In three days we collected more than 10K images*. 
   - **IMX681 face detection model** (We needed a lightweight model for on-Sensor-DNN a person trained a network for us but it was not compatible.(*Situation*) We had to train a network which is compatible with Sony's compiler (*Task) I suggested to train the network by myself (*Action*) We could finally figure out how to train that network, ran a demo and absorbed a lot of attention) 
   - **Face detection model developed by mobilevision** (Several peoplpe tried and couldnt, I dod the job however it was not my responsibility
   - **AE issue with Gesture detection** , read datasheet (My responsibility was to train a network for on-device- sensor-dnn. I trained the networ and passed it to the firmware team. But they kept getting nonsense results. They approached to me and I showed to them that my netork worked very well on the devboard and that they had done something to mess up the network(*situation*) We wanted to have this demo for Mark Zakerburg and we did not know what was the issue. At this pint we were sure that the issue was not from the model that I trained. I took the initiative and read all the documentations for the DNN and found that the AEC was not enabled by default on the smart glasses. So I asked the firmware team if they had enabled the flag.(*Action*) By enabling the flag with one line of code the issue was resolved.
   - #### - Tell me about a time when you had to make an important decision without approval from your boss
   - Situation: I was the DRI for FD for smart glasses. We had developed two versions of FD one for DSP and one for CPU. We promised the FD for video only. 
   - Problem: In the IQ test right before shipping the dog fooders came up with many instances of bad exposure in the snapshot case
   - The product manager was very concenred and we went to a meeting with all the stakeholders. They said they could not ship this as is  and we had only two weeks. ZBB which is production code sealing.
   - Action: My manager was on PTO and was not available to I made the call and provided the DSP solution without my boss approval
   - Result: The issue was solved, we could ship the product on-time and when my manager came back she approved my decision.

> - Provide examples of how you've prioritized customer needs in your previous roles, showcasing your commitment to understanding and addressing customer pain points.
> - Discuss specific initiatives or projects where you've gone above and beyond to deliver exceptional customer experiences, highlighting the outcomes and impact.

**Sample Questions:**

- Tell me about a time you had to make an urgent decision without data
- Tell me about a time when you launched a feature with known risks
- Tell me about a time when you found an opportunity that no one else saw.

- #### Describe a situation when you were forced to make a quick decision without data. 
What was the result, and what would you change?
*You should be able to take some calculated risks* 
   - Situation: Designed FD for Video and tested everything was fine except for some color tuning problems which the tuning team said they would take care of it with a new patch a day before the demo. They came up with a new patch and verified in the lab environment everything was ok.
   - Problem: On a big Demo day for VPs I found that we had a lot of AEC flickers which we did not have it before.
   - The AEC flicker could be due to a harsh tuning of AEC with the new patch. (mention hystresis)
   - The IQ tuning team is in Bulgaria and due to time difference I did not have access to them.
   - I suspected they have pushed a new patch to the HAL layer code. I could not even revert the patch because the older one had some color tuning problems.
   - I decided to do a running average filetering in my own code instantly and push the new library to the device. 
   - Risk: The face BBX could be a bit laggy but the outcome was great.

- #### Tell me about a time when you launched a feature with known risks

   - I had to train a gesture detection model without a device
   - We did not know how the model would actually work in real world cases. We had n way to test it.
   - We even did not have any sample input data, all we knew was it was monochrome image with resolution of 160x120 with binning.
   - We simulated the data, collected data with Meta glasses. trained a model. 
   - The model worked but we had to do some finetuning
   - We would have added a state machine to make the false positives more handle-able

- #### Tell me about a time when you found an opportunity that no one else saw.
   - I was the FD DRI for rayban Glasses. One day I was thinking that its bad the Meta glasses cannot have selfie for instagram live.
   - I thought what if we can switch the stream from the glasses to the watch when we are live on instagram and make a cosntellation of Meta devices work together.
   - I proposed the idea to my manager and a product manager in Meta, and they liked the idea.
   - We wrote the proposal for a MZ demo and was approved by the VP. 
   - I became the DRI and prototyped it. So we designed stream switch with face detection and motion signal from the watch.


- #### Describe a moment when you introduced a feature with known risks?
At Meta, we were developing a face detection pipeline for a wearable device that had very strict latency and power constraints. Toward the end of the development cycle, I proposed introducing a temporal smoothing feature to improve detection stability — essentially using a short buffer of recent frames to reduce flickering detections.

I knew this added a small delay (~30–50ms) to the pipeline, which was a known risk given our real-time performance targets. However, based on internal testing and UX evaluations, we saw that the improved consistency significantly enhanced user trust, especially during quick head movements.

Before rolling it out, I flagged the latency increase to the performance and systems teams, and we ran additional power and thermal profiling. I also made sure the feature was modular and tunable, so it could be disabled or adjusted dynamically in production.

Post-launch, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive — users found the system more “natural” and “less glitchy,” and the added latency was within acceptable bounds. In hindsight, the decision was risky, but it struck the right balance between engineering constraints and user experience.

- #### Have you ever been assigned a project deadline earlier than you had anticipated 
  What was the outcome, and how did you handle it?
   - MZ demo was brought forward due to MZ schedule.(*Situation*)
   - We had to create and end-to-end demo (*task*)
   - Escalated to director, Added people to the team, made things in parallel. (*Action*)
   - The demo went very well successfully (*outcome*)

**Understanding Have Backbone Principle**
"Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”

> - Have an example ready where you were able to deliver successfully on a project even though you had voiced your disagreement earlier in the process
> - Show that you understand the pros & cons of a certain decision (even though you don't 100% agree, you can still see the merit of the decision).

### How to answer “Tell me about a time you had a conflict”
Okay, let’s see what interviewers are looking for and what you need to know in order to ace this question. We’ve distilled all of it into five key points. Read and absorb them, and then we’ll show you some example answers. 

1. **Demonstrate empathy**
More than anything else, the interview is testing you for empathy here. They want to see that you're capable of seeing things from somone else's perspective, and thereby able to reflect on your own behavior and identify points for improvement.

With that in mind, talk about how you listened and understood a conflicting viewpoint. Describe how you asked the right questions, sought common ground and examined your own assumptions.

2. **Try to describe a conflict that you successfully resolved**
In answers to behavioral questions like this, you need to be the hero of your story. The interviewer wants to hear how you (not someone else!) resolved the conflict, so if possible use an example that had a positive outcome thanks to your actions.

Think very carefully before using an example where the conflict got too serious or was impossible to resolve - even if none of it was your fault, just by association it may not reflect well on you.

3. **Consider using a group conflict situation**
If you're still fairly junior, this might be tricky, but for maximum points talk about a work conflict that involved a group of people.

Why? Because by describing how you were able to resolve the conflict successfully, you'll demonstrate stronger leadership skills than if the conflict had been just between you and someone else. After all, being able to influence, align and persuade various different stakeholders is a key part of a management role.

4. **Demonstrate backbone**
For competitive roles, interviewers love to see some that you've got some "backbone". Amazon even include "Have backbone: disagree and commit" as one of their leadership principles. In this context, you can see that a conflict of opinions can actually be a good thing, rather than something to be avoided.

Any group of smart leaders will disagree at some point. Your interviewer will want to see that you know when to challenge ideas and escalate problems to senior leadership if necessary. At the same time, they want to know that you can sense the right time to move forward regardless of your disagreement. Show that you’re capable of striking that balance.

5. **Structure your answer**
“Tell me about a time you had a conflict” is a behavioral interview question. Behavioral questions are when the interviewer asks you about past experiences in order to assess whether you display the kind of behaviors they’re looking for.

Using an answer framework will help you structure your answers to behavioral questions. You’ll see that most of our “Tell me about a time you had a conflict” example answers below follow the SPSIL framework: 

- **Situation**
- **Problem**
- **Solution**
- **Impact**
- **Lessons**

We recommend you use the **SPSIL** framework, as we believe it’s better than the more commonly-used STAR framework.

If you want to see why SPSIL is better, see our complete guide to behavioral interview questions. 

**What NOT to Do**

There are some very common pitfalls when answering "Tell me about a time you had a conflict", so make sure you avoid them.

- **Don't say you've never had a conflict**
It can be tempting to say that you've never had a conflict, that you're a very empathetic person who has always got on well with all their coworkers and peers. This might well be true, but even if it is, it's not a strong answer.
Why not? Because top employers want to hire people with leadership potential, and once you're in a leadership position, some conflicts are inevitable as you are forced to take more difficult decisions. By saying you've never had a conflict, you're passing up the chance to demonstrate that you're capable of getting a positive outcome from difficult situations.
If you really can't think of any type of conflict you've experienced at work, you could use one from your personal life (not too personal!) but you'll want to clearly explain why the lessons you learned are relevant to the role.

- **Avoid spending too long on the conflict itself**
Try not to spend too long setting up the situation and talking about what was causing the conflict, especialy if it's a personality clash siutation. It's usually more powerful to focus more on the positive stuff - how you resolved the conflict, the positve impact, and the lessons learned.

- **Don't badmouth anyone**
You might have an example of working with a customer or co-worker who was being really difficult, and that's fine, but avoid putting all the blame on their bad behavior. It's a negative experience for the interviewer to listen to you complaining about another person and doesn't reflect very well on you - they want to hire someone who will bring out the best in people, not the worst.
Your answer will be much stronger if you can keep a positive focus in your answer and demonstrate empathy and self-reflection.

**Avoid giving away confidential details**
Even within the four walls of an interview room, you should still respect the confidentiality of your employers and co-workers past and present. If you describe dealing with sensitive issues or negative behavior, avoid giving away the identity of the people involved.

### Conflict Section
**Sample Questions:**
- #### Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker or manager and how you approached it?
   - **Situation:** We had a MZ demo and the deadline had been pull closer because of MZ's schedule. We had no time and this was a high impact project. My manager was very stressed and kept telling the team that in the past years if the demo got wrong someone will be impacted hardly. The whole team was stressed out. 
   - **Problem**: My manager put some extra tasks on each one's plate. Although I was the DRI of the project but she was very stressed and was micromanaging the team. One of the team members snapped and said he wanted to quit. This brought up a tension in the team. If he would quit, the project would have been doomed for sure because he was our software man.
   - **Solution** I took the initiative as the DRI of the project and talked to my manager and my teammate separately. I told my coworker that I would take care of some of his works. An I told him that he had to understand my manager was under a huge stress and that his quitting at this step would hurt the team, his credibility and his future career. I told him that he had to mange his stress and I was there for him. I empathized with him that I understood that his work was undervalued and assured him I will reflect the value of his work to the leadership.
   - At the same time I talked to my manager and empathized with her, and assured her that we can make it to the deadline. We tried to reprioretize other tasks we had to put less pressure on the team. We asked another person to join the team to have extra hadns.
   - **Impact** we made it to the deadline and our demo went well. MZ liked our demo and our project became POR.
   - **Lessons** There is always unpredictbales that happen to the team, and people might lose control. Managers are also humans and they might snap, We have to be patient and empathize with other. If we are under pressure ask for help.
-  
- #### Tell me about a time your work was criticized
   - **Situaton**: I was the DRI for the face detetion. It was my first project at Meta I wanted to show my ability by over engineering. I wanted to be slick and perfect.
   - **Problem** My manager told me that less is better. Meaning that If I over engineer every feature, then we would not have enough time to deliver multiple projects in a year.
   - **Solutoin** I prioritized the featre capabilities. Those whoe were essential, good to haves and less important ones. Then I put my effort on the most important one. (*video was not imporantant and we needed to priortize the snapshot case*)
   - **Impact** I could learn deliver multiple project on the deadline with prioratizing the task. 
   - **Lessons** Always look for minimum viable solution as opposed to complicated solutions.

- #### Tell me about a time when people in your team didn not agree with you
   - **Situation:** I was a research scientist at Huawei and I was working on a hot topic and we wanted to publish a paper.
   - **Problem:** Multiple time I came up with ideas and implemented and got good results but as we started to write the paper some else woul publish our idea or something very close to our idea.
   - **Conflict** My skip manaer asked me to change my topic as the topic was hard to publish, he also said that another team in the company is also working on that topic. But I insisted that I was very close to the peak and that I wanted to finish what I had stasted before.
   - **impact** He agreed reluctantlu. At last I could publish the paper. But I did not get the recognition because another ddepartment was working on that topic.
   - **Leesson** I learned that I have to trust my manager as well as my personal feelings. I have to consider the team's benefit. 

- #### Tell me about a time you had a conflict with your team but decided to go ahead with their proposal
   - DSP model vs CPU model
   - I decided to go with the CPU model as  my manager said it was her sweet spot
   - I planned a backup solution that if cpu failed we have DSP.
   - eventually failed and we had already dsp so we replaced.
   - conflicts are inevitible. it is always goof to listen to othersm in spscific cases you have to trust ut judgement too.

> ## Invent and simplify
**Understanding Have Invent and Simplify Principle**
"Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”
> **How to answer Invent and Simplify questions?**
> - Describe how you came up with a MVP or phase 1 in a long-term project.
> - Think about examples where you've come up with innovative, alternative solutions instead of building a feature that required engineering resources.
> - For example, maybe you used a Google form instead of building your own registration form, or changing the standard operating procedure instead of building a separate feature.

**Sample questions**

- #### Tell me about a time you re-designed a process and why
   - **Scenario** We have demos in Meta at least two times a year where teams showcase their acheivments.
   - **Task** We had to develop each algorithm, write a lot of c++ code and create library and do alot of unncessary software work to be able to showcase our achievement on the glasses.
   - **Action** Instead of writing all those code and etc, I wrote a simple streamer to send the live video from the device to the PC. When receiving the frames we run any algorithm on pc using python. And we show the results on the viewer.
   - **Result** This saved a lot of time for the team members and alot of people from different teams also approached us for this.
- #### Tell me about a time you solved a big problem in your company
   - Face detection snapshot case(*scenario*) We did not have time for v1 and we wanted to deliver the result. There was no time for reinvention or any debugging.(*Task*) I copied all the frame over without detecting in everyframe (*Action*) Solved our problem (*Result*)

- #### Tell me about a moment when you worked on a project and recognized a chance to do something more significant or effective than the original goal
   - MZdemo the goal was stream switching, I added gesture as well


- #### Describe a moment when you discovered a more effective technique to complete a task that someone else was working on
What message did you deliver to them?
- Gesture detection model, we could not get quite a good accuracy for the classification problem.
- I decided to add a segmentation head to the back bone.
- Created GT labels the fly using SAM.
- We trained a network that could do the classification as well as segmentation. Then we removed  the seg. head
- The accuracy improved a lot.

 > ## Are Right alot
 **Understanding Are Right alot principle**
 "Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.”
Amazon expects its employees to produce solutions as quickly as possible and to be capable of making decisions with little information. Show that you know how to take calculated risks and that you're comfortable disproving your own opinions before moving ahead. When describing past failures, show what you’ve learned. 

**Sample Questions**

- #### Tell me how you deal with ambiguity
   - Gesture detection project, no device no input data
   - Dnn project from scratch

- #### Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions.
   - Face detection (CPU + Tracker)
   - DSP + no tracker
   
- #### Tell me about a time you applied judgment to a decision when data was not available
   - We wanted to demo with Malibu watch, the device was not yet present. They had an upbringing of the software in May and by end of May we had to demo our project for MZ. This was a high impact project. So I had to decide weather or not we take the risk and take this project or not. Because there was a high chance that the devicce was not ready by the time. I managed to get all the software pipeline and data that I needed for the device ready in place. Several people tried to work with us. How ever I tried to open a risk escaping door. I tried everything on an old version of a device that was obsolete and got it to work. before the device arrives. Once the device arrived we could not reach the deadline but since I had a di-risk factor in mind we still succeeded.

> **How to answer Deliver Results questions**
> - Showcase your track record of delivering measurable results and achieving key objectives in your previous roles.
> - Provide specific examples of projects or initiatives where you set clear goals, developed action plans, and executed effectively to drive impactful outcomes.
> - Quantify your achievements wherever possible, using metrics and data to demonstrate the impact of your contributions.

- #### Tell me about a time you came across a scenario where the deadline given to you for a project was earlier than expected
   -MZ demo, deadline was pulled forward because of MZ schedule, escalated to the team director, we borrowed engineers from other teams in the org. Prioritized tasks, broke the task into peaces and each person did some part. We managed to have several dry runs asked people for their feedback and we debugged as we developed. 
- #### Tell me about the most challenging project you ever worked on
   -Face Detection 
- #### Tell me about a time when you had to handle pressure
   -Face Detection, lots of bugs, 3AM UBN tickets.

Why was it significant?
   -Face detection, it was huge, mention all the problems, latency, power, upl, etc. 
- #### Tell me about a time you proposed a non-intuitive solution to a problem and how you identified that it required a different way of thinking
   - **Situation**: We had this tiny model for Gesture Detection 200kb. We wanted to train a simple classifier to recongnize a particular hand gesture.
   - The problem was we did not have enough data, it took us a long time to take 10K pos and neg data. Yet the model would easilt fit to the data with a high accuracy but in real world we had a lot of false positives.
   - **Task** was to implement a realiable gesture detection  model.
   - **Action** for the first round instead of inefficient capturing of snapshots I managed to record videos and sample from the videos. This way I had alot of data with different backgrounds and hand gestures.
   - Then using SAM model we segmented the models and created a segmentation map for all the data we had.
   - We added a segmentation head on top of our model and trained for both classification and segmentation. Then we removed the segmentation head.
   - **Result** our false positive rate droped significantly and our model became much more reliable.
   - **Reflection** Some time creative ideas can help to improve your work. They might be very simple but helps with efficiency.
- #### What was the largest project you have executed
   - Face Detection

**Sample Questions**
- #### Tell me about a time you provided feedback that was helpful to a peer
   - MZ demo, a coworker was under pressure and was asked to do things that was not his expertise.
   - He snapped and said he wanted to quit. 
   - My manager got anxious because she herself was under a huge pressure and managed to put him aside.
   - The guy did not eventually quit but my manager never gve him a project and they went to a big conflict.
   - I approached the guy and told him that he was not emotionally stable and that when you say I want to quit you have to prepare first. 

- #### Tell me about a time you hired or worked with people smarter than you are
- We wanted to hire a person who was an expert in computer graphics, we wanted to pitch for a project related to portrait mode photography that needed some relighting techniques that I was not an expert of. 
- So we started reading papers before hiring anyone to get an insight of what exactly we were looking and then we prommoted the job.
- Applicant rushed and we had to handpick them. Eventually we decided to hire two interns and make them competing agaisnt each other.
- We hired the smarter one, he was fast, he picked up thing very fast. He would come with results very fast and he was very independent. 
- The only problem was coming from grad school he had many ideas that were fantastic for academia but not aplicable to product line.
- We put 1-1 meeting with him on a regular basis, we pretend that we were managing him but in reality we were learning from him. 
- I had to put extra time to learn his ideas and sometimes go beyond my working hours to catch up with him.
- I encouraged him all the time and at the same time tried to maintain the professionalism such that he listens to me. 
- We eventually could deliver the first phase of the project which was the proof of concept. We pitched for the project and file an NTI for it.

 > ## Frugality
  
  **Understanding Frugality (do more with less people and resources)**
  "Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.”
  
**Sample Questions**
- #### Tell me about a time you successfully delivered a project with limited budget or resources
   - We wanted to perform portrait mode photo and we did not have headcount, we had some limited budget for CWs but we wanted to keep it. We had a choice to spend some money on curating data and anotating them. 
   - We came up wth the idea of using SAM instead of hiring people to annotate data. 
- #### Tell me about the last time you figured out a way to keep an approach simple or to save on expenses
   - We wnated to demo, but it was hard each time to develop whole lot of libraries. We decided maybe the best approach for proof of concept maybe to use some Nvidia chipsets like Jetsons. But we came up with a beeter idea of developing a viewer and do everythin on laptop.
- **When managing a budget, what are some ways you get more out of less?**

   1. **Prioritized Essential Project Components:**
   - **Comprehensive Review:** Conducted a thorough analysis of all project elements to identify critical features versus non-essential components.
      - **Focused Resource Allocation:** Redirected resources to develop core computer vision algorithms and upgrade necessary hardware for real-time processing, deferring less impactful tasks.

   2. **Adopted Open-Source Technologies:**
      - **Cost-Efficient Tools:** Replaced expensive proprietary software with open-source libraries such as **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow**, significantly reducing software expenses.
      - **Customized Solutions:** Tailored these open-source tools to meet specific project requirements, enhancing flexibility and reducing development costs.

   3. **Optimized Computational Resources:**
      - **Cloud Migration:** Transitioned computational workloads to scalable cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Google Cloud**, leveraging their flexible pricing models.
      - **Efficient Resource Management:** Implemented precise resource allocation strategies to ensure optimal usage, minimizing unnecessary expenditures.

   4. **Fostered Enhanced Team Collaboration:**
      - **Regular Cross-Functional Meetings:** Organized consistent meetings with cross-functional teams to align on priorities and manage resource constraints effectively.
      - **Promoted Knowledge Sharing:** Encouraged a culture of continuous learning and knowledge exchange, enabling team members to contribute across various domains and maximizing collective expertise without expanding the team size.

   5. **Implemented Agile Methodologies:**
      - **Iterative Development:** Introduced agile practices to facilitate flexible and iterative development cycles, allowing the team to quickly identify and address issues.
      - **Continuous Feedback Loops:** Established regular feedback sessions with stakeholders to ensure project requirements were met without exceeding budget limitations.

  **Understanding Learn and be Curious Principle**
 “Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.”
 
 > **How to answer Learn and be curious questions?**
 > - Highlight your passion for continuous learning and professional growth, emphasizing your curiosity and eagerness to explore new ideas, technologies, and methodologies.
> - Share examples of how you've pursued learning opportunities, whether through formal education, self-study, or hands-on experimentation.

**Sample questions**
- #### Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly
   - Tell car detection in ALtumview
   - Tell D2go->Vizard and Gini
   - Diffusion models
- #### Tell me about your biggest career failure and what you learned from it
- #### Tell me about a time you taught yourself a skill
- Everythin, programing C# and ... computer vision
- #### Tell me about something you learned that made you better at your job
One of the most impactful things I learned was the importance of deeply understanding the end-to-end product context — not just the model metrics. Early in my career, I focused heavily on optimizing model accuracy, precision, and recall in isolation. But over time, I realized that a model that performs well in benchmarks can still fail users in the real world.

> This became especially clear when working on embedded face detection for AR glasses. We had a highly accurate model in the lab, but users were complaining about missed detections outdoors. That pushed me to dig deeper into non-ML factors like sensor exposure, lens glare, pipeline latency, and user ergonomics. I started collaborating more closely with cross-functional teams — firmware, UX, hardware — to better align our ML goals with product realities.
>
> Since then, I’ve made it a habit to validate ML choices not just in validation sets, but through in-the-wild testing, edge-case scenario analysis, and user feedback loops. That shift in mindset helped me deliver solutions that were not only smarter but also more reliable, efficient, and user-centered.

- #### Tell me about your biggest career failure and what you learned from it
   - **Situation** My manager asked me to train a very small gesture detection model for a demo another team wanted, I was highly incorporated with another project and did not have much time. She told me it was only a demo and probably a solution that works in a demo space should be suffiecient. I trained a model with a limited data a send it to the other team. 
   - **Problem** 
      - At first they were happy that the model worked. 
      - But later things became escalated as the mode had a lot of fals positive. 
      - This put the credibility of our team under question and reflected very bad on the team.
   - **Solution** 
      - Asked other team members to help me gather more and more data.
      -  Re-trained another model,
      -  Created a ROC curve and created a report on how the model is supposed to workd and give clear expectations
      -  We iteratively worked witrh the other team to improve the model 
   - **Impact**
      - We had a great demo with several VPs and pitched the idea of contextual AI for smart glasses 
   
   - **Lessons**  
      - Credibility of a team is very important
      - Never pass a not adequately tested model to another team
      - Never take a scope of a project for granted as to train a less reliable model 
      - If you are a DRI then take ownership despite what your manager says

> [!important]
> ## Insist on the highest standards

**Understanding Insist on the highest standards**
"Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.”

> **How to answer questions about Insist on highest standards?**
> - Explain your uncompromising commitment to excellence and quality in everything you do, highlighting your attention to detail and pursuit of perfection.
> - Share examples of how you've set and maintained high standards for yourself and your team, ensuring that deliverables meet or exceed expectations.
> - Discuss how you've established processes, guidelines, and quality assurance measures to uphold standards and drive continuous improvement.

**Sample Questions**
- #### Tell me about the most successful project you have done
   - Project flare removal,
      - I studied flare signiatures and found out that there were many different flare signatures are very diverse 
      - I did a thourhhg literature review on the techniques that were available
      - I clarified the bittle necks which were lack of data and resource to implement the big models and the probable issues.
      - I found that although we can come up with a solutio to this problem but delivering a high standard project is risky due to the             artifacts that may be still availble
      - I proposed that isntead of targetting all the flare signiatures target only one of them. The most common which was veiling lgare.
      - We developed a solution for that and we got very promisig results.
       
- #### Tell me about a project that you wish you had done better and how you would do it differently today
   - Face detection
      - I would write design documents from scratch
      - Talk to the IQ team for and the PMs for the KPIs

“Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.”

> - Share examples of how you've demonstrated integrity, transparency, and reliability in your interactions and decision-making processes.
> - Discuss your approach to building strong relationships based on mutual respect, open communication, and delivering on promises.

- #### How do you earn trust with a team

   - Communicated regularly with the stakeholders and report about the progress
   - Deliver step by step according to the milestones you defined.
   
- #### Tell me a piece of difficult feedback you received and how you handled it
   - Jie told me you should improve your skills and be at Dongs level.
- #### A co-worker constantly arrives late to a recurring meeting
  What would you do
> If a co-worker is consistently late to a recurring meeting, my first step would be to understand the reason behind it. I’d look for patterns — are they coming from another meeting, or is the meeting time inconvenient across time zones?
>
> If it starts to impact the team’s productivity, I’d address it respectfully. For example, I might pull them aside or send a casual message like, *“Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve had to join our syncs a bit late — is the timing clashing with something else? Just wanted to check in and see if we should consider adjusting it.”*
>
> Often, these issues are unintentional and can be solved with a small scheduling change or by clarifying expectations. If the behavior continues and affects the team, I’d bring it up during a retrospective or with the manager in a constructive, solution-oriented way.
>
> My goal is to foster accountability without confrontation — keeping team communication respectful and effective.

"Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.”

> ## Success and scale bring broad responsibility

**understanding Success and scale bring broad responsibility priciple**
"We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.”
