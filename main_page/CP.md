Video compression is essential for efficiently storing and transmitting video data. Traditional video compression standards like H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC rely on hand-crafted algorithms and heuristics to reduce redundancy in video sequences. With the advent of deep learning, researchers have started exploring data-driven approaches to video compression, aiming to learn optimal representations directly from data.

his tutorial explains the entire workflow of traditional video compression, combining motion estimation, motion compensation (including warping), residual calculation, DCT transformation, quantization, and encoding. We'll add mathematical relationships between the blocks to provide a deeper understanding.

Motion estimation and motion compensation are critical components in video compression algorithms. They exploit temporal redundancies between consecutive frames in a video sequence to reduce the amount of data required for efficient storage and transmission. By predicting the motion of objects from one frame to another, we can represent a video more compactly without significantly compromising visual quality.
